The treasure has been found! Now we must take steps to make sure we keep it, for ourselves alone...
####
## Text 329 ##
This people has always fanned the flames of hatred against us. Our small war fleet will therefore join your cause!
####
## Text 330 ##
We will support your fight. A group of our best healers is on its way to you.
####
## Text 331 ##
We did it. The treasure is ours!
####
## Text 332 ##
We will never get to the treasure this way!
####
## Text 333 ##
In the Roman fortress, we found a guide to a treasure map. As soon as the Roman settlements have been destroyed, we will start searching...

Here is the treasure map! It shows the way to an island. X marks the treasure. Now all we need is the artifact...

## Text 348 ##
The Roman presence in this area has grown swiftly! And the time is ripe to do something about this. We will not let ourselves be turned into suppressed serfs on our own ancestral lands! The Romans occupying the cities appear unimpressed when we remind them of the Three Island Agreement. We will show those arrogant ignoramuses what it means when Mayans defend their own land! May the Great Jaguar be with us...
####
## Text 349 ##
In a Roman camp, an interesting guide to a valuable treasure fell into our hands! It is not a treasure map. But the guide leads us to a certain area of land.
The Dark People already rule there. But the treasure should be ours! To get to the actual treasure map, we will have to confront the Dark Enemy. For the treasure map is said to be somewhere in Dark People's territory, whatever that means...
####
## Text 350 ##
It must be an unusual treasure! The treasure map was drawn with our Mother Earth. But she is no longer recognizable, thanks to the dominance of the Dark People. After the transformation of the contaminated land, we could clearly see what had been hidden before. An island with a striking cross formation marks the location of the treasure. Our best draftsmen have received instructions to copy the map.
But before we search for the treasure, we must find the artifact that, it is said, will enable us to lay hands on the treasure! According to legend, the artifact is said to lie in an old ruined city which our scouts have already located. We cannot take the direct route to the ruined city, because there is a Viking settlement in the way. But we will never share with that people. We must get to the treasure another way. We will fake a claim to the territory! Those Thor-worshipping fools have no idea what wondrous things are within their grasp…

We seem to have reached the area in which the treasure is hidden. But we are not alone here! One of the few Romans allied with us has brought us reports of Vikings and a strange tribe that lets no one approach it. Under no circumstances will we let ourselves be frightened off. We will explore the territory and try to find the island depicted on the treasure map. Our objective cannot be far away. Perhaps the strange people are the last hurdle we must overcome? Are they the guardians of the treasure foretold in the legends? Forward, brave Mayans, and may the Gods be with us!

The Trojans have stolen one of our most beautiful jewels: Livia, the wife of Emperor Augustus. All of reverence and veneration go to her; all our devotion belongs to Livia our muse. She is the heart of our people! This brazen kidnapping precludes negotiations. We will not let ourselves be intimidated by their strength or their overpowering city. Sound the war trumpets in Mars' honor. Let us destroy the dastardly cowards!
####
## Text 432 ##
Excellent! Our toils have borne fruit. We were able to establish a bridgehead on enemy territory. The Trojans will not tolerate our presence on their land; soon they will attack us. Now is the time when we must expand this bridgehead into an imposing settlement. When our settlement is strong and fortified, we will start building an army that has no equal!
But before we can attack Troy we must weaken the enemy where they least expect it. We will comb the surrounding territory for isolated Trojan outposts. We must completely destroy all of them. Let us carve out a corridor for ourselves to guarantee our troops a free road to the main city of Troy. Livia, we are coming!
####
## Text 433 ##
Our siege of the city of Troy has been going on now for months. But we haven't been able to move a single step forward! The Trojans fight like lions and are not ready to set Livia free.
It doesn't look like we will make any headway using our arts of warfare alone. The Trojans' constant outbreaks are visibly weakening us. Their fortifications are insurmountable! Only treachery will bring us our objective! A Trojan defector has told us that the Trojans venerate horses above all else. And so, working with our engineers, the cunning and crafty Tacitus has built a gigantic wooden horse. There is room inside it to hide a troop of soldiers and hide them well. We are recruiting this elite troop at this moment! They shall be the perfect warriors to infiltrate the city!
####
## Text 434 ##
Last night we completed the wooden horse. After months of training, our elite troop is eager to embark on this mission!
Those Trojans! They did not see through our ruse! In the grey light of dawn, the Trojans discovered the horse before their gates, and hauled it into their city with the greatest respect. Tonight, our troops will strike the decisive blow and take over from within the Trojans' own walls. Now the Trojans will feel Jupiter's anger! At last, we will get our revenge for the abduction of Livia!

They have grown weary during the recent wars, and they have cast their swords aside and reached for their wine barrels! Our small settlement, still under construction, finds itself confronted by innumerable dangers. The enemy were able to build three camps in secret without betraying their presence to us. We are boxed in, surrounded by enemies, and our fate appears to be sealed. Shall we peacefully meet our dark fate, without a fight? Let us show the enemy what we are made of! Let them feel the edge of our swords! Our reinforcements are on the way. But how long will we have to hold out? So long as we continue to hold the fortress, our men will face the enemy with brave heads held high...

Aeneas@Found a new settlement with Lavinia and ensure the safety of your subjects!@Together with Aeneas, we were able to flee from the besieged city of Troy before it was too late. A mountain awaited us at the end of the difficult journey, and it provided us with a new home....We found a new ally in King Latinius. He was well disposed toward Aeneas and sent us a ship of provisions filled with the most precious goods. The ship hit a reef... but the goods were washed up on land, praise be to the gods! Latinius had bigger ideas for Aeneas, however. It was his wish that Aeneas should wed his daughter Lavinia! But the queen had other plans. She wanted her daughter to become the wife of Turnus, the son of the neighboring king Rutuler, so that the queen could also share in Turnus's riches... Latinius's queen sowed the seeds of discord between Latinius and Aeneas! And so it came to pass that Rutuler, Turnus, and the deceived Latinius armed themselves for war against Aeneas...

Our fighting strength and morale were bad...

But if the Trojans become a sea power, they will mercilessly drive us from this island. There will be no room left for us.

Then the village elder Pilaeus reported to us that they had found large gold deposits. The news had already spread like wildfire! Above all, Midas, the king of Carthage, hungered for the gold. But the surrounding kingdoms also lusted after the wealth... Grateful for our rescue, we promised to protect the village from the gold thieves.

The Romans were seized by fear of our warlike men. They appeared to retreat. But it was just a ploy to gain time to concoct a devilish plan.

In view of their superior strength, our only option was to flee... The cowardly conspirators first subjugated the area once ruled by the Mayans... The proud young Mayan prince Chichén Itzá set out with a troop of loyal Mayans to assert their claim to the land and to punish the oppressors. We landed at a site called the Place of Burned Earth!

And suddenly we could see it. A strange construction, like a giant insect made of metal and wood and armed with stingers! The head of the flying monster was a cupola made of metal and glass! Our breath caught in our throats at the sight of the devil machine's rotor, which shimmered with an ominous light! Dark Warriors climbed out of the vehicle! As quickly as it had arrived, the flying darkness disappeared again into the clouds... Now it looks like we will be safe nowhere!

We have done it! The construction plans for the manacopters have been destroyed! This won't stop production at other sites, but at least further development of the things has been stopped!
But we found even more than that. We found a list of herbs, some unknown to us, and a pot filled with a greenish substance... Our leading scientists investigated the substance. It appears that Morbus has a recipe, shrouded in mystery, for a strange elixir that could cure his allergy to green, fertile land. There is no question that for Morbus this is the elixir to unimaginable power! According to the documents, Morbus lacks only one more herb... But we have seized a map showing the locations of the Dark People's temples! In consideration of the Dark Threat, our mission is now clear and unmistakable: All the peoples must become allies in the last battle against the Darkness!

We have been initiated into the highest levels of magic, and we now know how the "Turn Land Green" spell works. On Dark Land, amazingly enough, the "Convert Land" spell will turn the earth green again!... The priest also gave us a gift of manna.

The statue of the petrified man that we found a few moons ago has disappeared. Only its pedestal is left. Scorched, blackened earth surrounds the pedestal; just looking at that chared ground fills us with disgust and horror.

All our scientists are baffled. They can give us no advice on how to deal with the danger. We cannot combat this "plague"! And the raw material deposits are starting to run out. That seals our decision. We will flee! Pack your few belongings, and let us put to sea! We are facing an uncertain future, but if we stay on this isle we will perish...
####
## Text 584 ##
We have come across a new, cultivatable island! Dark Land does not frighten us. We discovered a people unknown to us: the Romans. They appear to be friendly. We gratefully accepted the help they offered us in building our tower. But we will also have to take them up on their promise to stand by our side in the future should trouble occur. The Mayans, led by the sinister Montalban, have taken over a mountain chain in the North. They claim the whole thing for themselves! They have unequivocally refused our offer of a pact. But our survival depends on the raw materials located there! A clash has thus become unavoidable...
####
## Text 585 ##
Our conversations with the other peoples have already taught us much. One of the most important concepts is our new understanding of the danger brought by the Dark People! We only know the Dark Warriors from stories and old wives' tales; until now, we have never been forced to confront them... The other peoples seem very concerned, however. They have called for a meeting of all the peoples, to take place in the ruins of an old abandoned temple. Scouts have reported to us that the ruins are surrounded by Dark Land. As the new comrades-in-arms in the alliance of peoples, it is our job to pave the way for the meeting... We must eliminate the traces left behind by the Dark People and make the land around the temple green again and suitable for cultivation. It appears that this is a test we must pass!
####
## Text 586 ##
The Darkness has caught up with us. We are about to face a confrontation with the Warriors of the Dark People! The isle is ours, but the Dark Enemy is still superior to us. Their monstrous flying machines, which we call manacopters, could cross the ocean waves at any time. We are helpless against surprise attacks!
But it is not hard for us to leave the isle, for it is running out of raw materials. How can our settlement become strong and great without raw materials? An expedition was dispatched and found a larger island to the southeast. A geologist took preliminary samples that indicate rich deposits of raw materials. If we want to survive, we must dare to set out for new shores!
####
## Text 587 ##
The Dark People have taken unscrupulous advantage of our absence. One of our settlements on the mainland has been at the mercy of constant attacks. The few settlers that are left are about to capitulate... It's only a question of time before our settlement is overrun by Dark Warriors.
A fierce storm by the coast attacked the ships bearing our reinforcements. But now that we have braved the forces of nature and survived, nothing else will stop us from coming to the aid of our people. Theseus's determination inspires us! The first danger is already awaiting us en route. Our lookouts have told us that we must cross Dark Land...
####
## Text 588 ##
Our gods are not well disposed toward us. Yesterday's friends are today's enemies! Their greed has made them form an alliance. Now they are challenging us and our Roman friends! But we will go to battle with eyes open. We do not believe that the Dark People have been subjugated so quickly! We are certain that the Dark People are experimenting with these flying devices in secret. And their deliberate expansion into fertile territories leads us to believe they have other, terrible objectives...
####
## Text 589 ##
The shock has almost paralyzed us. Our allies and both our enemies have suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Dark People. Thanks be to Hephaestus that we were spared... The Dark People stole some sort of magic plant from the Romans. What is its role in Morbus's plans?

In the midst of this uncertainty we received news demanding fast action. Our lookouts, risking life and limb, were able to locate the Dark People's secret research laboratory! That is where the manacopters were invented, the Dark People's key weapon. We must destroy all the manufacturing blueprints! For us, continued production of these devil machines will mean perpetual danger, in all places, at all times! Perhaps this laboratory will contain other secrets, and we will find out what goal Morbus is pursuing... But we must hurry. Our scouts report that uncontrollable hordes of the Dark People are on the way to this place!
####
## Text 590 ##
As feared, the Dark People's reinforcements have arrived! Late, but in vastly superior strength, the Dark Hordes are advancing against our settlement. Fear has almost paralyzed us! We are trying, together with the Romans, to hold out against the Dark Warriors for as long as possible...

The gates of our fortifications are starting to give way. No end of the Dark Flood is visible on the horizon... But we must stand fast until our ships arrive with reinforcements. The search for the herb must wait...
####
## Text 591 ##
After the falling apart of the alliance of the peoples, it is time for a new diplomatic start. We will send a priest to each people! The importance of this mission is unquestionable. Only together, as an alliance of the peoples, will we win! We must find the herb before Morbus does!
The routes to the settlements contain many dangers. Darkness lurks everywhere. The priests we dispatch must be protected against enemy influence and must reach their targets without suffering hurt or damage. If this attempt fails, our future will lie in a field of Dark Earth...
####
## Text 592 ##
After having signed the agreement, we can now rush together into battle against the Dark People! Morbus appears to still be searching for the herb...
But thanks be to Hephaestus. An allied Viking tribe succeeded in discovering the magic herb! A priest must harvest it as quickly as possible. But the Dark People have already arrived and are ready under Morbus's leadership to do all it takes to get to the magic plant! Even if the Vikings and us do not manage to harvest it before the Dark Hordes, we have nevertheless prepared for that eventuality. The cleverest among us have succeeded in developing a poison that will render the herb useless. We were not able to test the poison beforehand. With Hephaestus's blessing, may it work for us when push comes to shove...
####
## Text 593 ##
The crucial battle lies ahead! Scouts for the alliance of peoples have found Morbus's fortress. They bring reports of a well-nigh unstoppable army of the Dark People. We are about to engage in a tough battle! And if we want to win it, we must make careful preparations...

The meeting point has been selected! The Vikings have prepared the place. The meeting of the armies for the final battle is approaching... They are expecting us! Come, Comrades, let us build a fleet of ships! Our army must grow! We must stand strong, side by side with our allies. Our plan must succeed before Morbus can realize his sinister schemes...
####
## Text 594 ##
Our feet are sinking into the stinking earth contaminated by the Dark People. Only a few yards into this bog, our war machines got stuck fast. Our troops are exhausted from the difficult march through the thick mud. Dense fog blinds us and we are not at all sure if we are still on the right path...
But suddenly the fog clears. Deformed trees rise up out of the dead earth. Insects as big as your fist dart through the nightmarish landscape. Ahead of us is the goal we are searching for. On the horizon, we see Morbus's Dark Fortress towering up into the overcast sky! Large and mighty, it appears to defy attack. Suddenly, the quiet is abruptly rent by the shrieks of one of our men... Dark hosts are moving in! They who suffocate the earth they walk on! To arms! The final battle will require all our strength! Now we will find out if Morbus was able to use the Elixir of Power to grow into an invincible titan...

Follow the scouts' advice. The east is a good location for more shipyards. Whatever you do, do not miss the green circle. It is your "magical signpost"! Use your time well, you have a lot of it available...

Be prepared, you will have to defend yourselves...

You should take early advantage of the space available on your terrain. Early production of manna will create a stockpile you can use in future difficulties. The land route is not the only way open to you...

Never lose sight of your goal! Do not spend more time than necessary destroying the Dark People...
####
## Text 602 ##
Start searching early for the gold deposits in the east!

The region has not been explored! Your allies are in the fog of war. Find them! The Dark People want to destroy them...

## Text 604 ##
The eastern borders must be secured!

Conquer the snowy mountains quickly. Behind them, your reward will be land for building...

A new people has been stranded on the coast near one of our northern settlements. They call themselves "Trojans"! We are curious about what we could learn from their culture and we want to support the strangers. But an aggressive tribe of Mayans has settled here. They are eager for battle! Their leader Toktal claims the entire region for himself! The Mayans are an unclear threat, the extent of which we cannot judge, both for the Trojans and for us... We must make a stand against the Mayans and destroy their settlement!
####
## Text 650 ##
The Dark Threat seems to be growing inexorably. Our scouts have discovered that the Dark People are constantly expanding and behaving much more aggressively than we were aware...

Now all know that the only way we can force this more powerful enemy to its knees, once and for all, is if we are united. The peoples, represented by special ambassadors, are going to meet to discuss what to do next. The meeting place is on the beach of an island. But we must remain ever watchful, because no contract has yet been signed...
####
## Text 651 ##
We, who are warriors through and through, always remain watchful. But our friends have forgotten that the Dark Enemy has not yet been defeated. Our new allies are all building settlements in this fertile region, and each plans to rely on the others for protection. But their own watchfulness seems not to matter to them any more.

And then what we feared did indeed happen. The Dark People recognized our alliance's weakness. It is attacking all the settlements simultaneously! These fools will be helpless against the superior strength of the Dark Warriors. There will hardly be any resistance... Only our people seems able to recruit soldiers with the necessary swiftness. This is our hour. We must take over the defense of the other peoples, and show the Dark Danger what it means when Odin and Thor's anger is awakened! The mission will be difficult but the alliance must live on...
####
## Text 652 ##
Our preparations are underway for a great attack against the Dark People's stronghold! Our excellent economic and military situation has turned us into the redeemers who will secure the rendezvous point... The meeting of all the peoples is about to take place!
But our scouts have discovered a settlement of Morbus's Dark Hordes at this location! Our next mission must therefore be to drive the Dark People away from this place. Only then can the alliance's troops assemble at the meeting point. May the battle bring great victory upon us!

An odd heaviness hangs in the air. There is talk of nearby lands that lie blackened, lands where trees and shrubs are withered and bent. Could this be the work of that band of Mayans with their terrible fire-spitting war machine? Reconnaissance reports bringing these descriptions are strangely similar to the dreams related by our priests.  Are the Mayans to be the ones to bring the Roman she-wolf to her knees? Our priests continue to speak of signs in their dreams, that a gardener will be the key to restoring the Wolf's health. A simple gardener?
The bronzed people are again at hand building up a new settlement. Our experience with the Mayans has grown. We now know all too well that we cannot afford to allow their increase in power to go unchecked.
####
## Text 804 ##
We were successful in decimating the Mayan settlement. As upsetting as the presence of their settlement was, the Dark Lands we encountered were even more distressing. We know from captured Mayans that they were not the cause for this and judging from both their reaction and the magnitude of the lands affected, there is little reason for doubt. The Mayans seem equally disturbed about these Dark Lands and have proposed that we join forces against this dark menace. It is not clear whether such an alliance is of any value. We have learned that our gardeners can reclaim these barren areas, that, as the dreams foretold, they can heal the land. Until we know more about the Dark Lands, though, it may be wise to cooperate with the Mayans.
####

Our hearts are heavy and our brows weighted with perplexity. Our forests are blackened, their proud trees gnarled and bent. The sacred burial grounds, the place of rest for the followers of Rolf, are surrounded by death and decay. What dark beast dares disturb this place of peace? 
Our spies have returned with reports that the Romans and Mayans make use of gardeners to free the land of its blackened decay. We pray that our gardeners can undo such unnatural damage.
####
## Text 806 ##
We succeeded in reclaiming the burial grounds of our ancestors. For this we can rejoice, but joy is mingled with sorrow. Many of our warriors fell when we were surprised by an unexpected menace, dark warriors inhabit these darkened lands! The eyes of these dark warriors held only emptiness but their arms held swords with the fever of death at their tips. We beat the dark warriors back but could not wipe them out because another threat appeared. The Mayans have been sighted again and although there are no reports of Romans in their company, this is cause enough for concern. We are not at full strength and it is not clear what the Mayans are planning. We must continue to push back the dark menace, all the while keeping an eye on the Mayans.
####
## Text 807 ##
We thought we had rid ourselves of the dark threat but it confronts us once more with a yet uglier face. Some of our citizens have been enslaved by the Dark Tribe and put to work on farms. There are reports that Vikings have also been enslaved. The Mayans may regret that they were so quick to terminate the peace with us. Unless, of course, they are in league with this sinister tribe.
Dream visions have returned to our priests. They see the Roman wolf trampling the dark mushrooms of the black lands. There is agreement among the priests that our task lies in destroying these farms, that we can free our citizens in this way from their horrible fate.
####
## Text 808 ##
We have spotted new settlements of the Romans and Vikings, and if experience is any guide, we have to assume that they will be joining forces again. Our priests have been visited anew with dreams where wolf and bear stride together. This the priests have seen clearly, but there was more - a third animal possibly, in frantic movement but shrouded in fog in the distance at the edge of the dreamscape. We must act before this alliance gains strength or we will be lost.
####
## Text 809 ##
The Roman and Viking settlements were destroyed. Both settlements were stronger than we had anticipated. Oddly, there were no signs that they had been conspiring to mount an attack on us. Their concerns seem to have been elsewhere. It is now all too clear what those concerns were - the dark lands and the Dark Tribe. We are now nothing more than an island encircled not by sea but by darkness. The Dark Tribe has surrounded us. The meanings of the earlier dreams have assumed the clarity of hindsight. The third animal was the jaguar, and the dream fog was from the dark lands.
Despite our last attack on the Romans and Vikings, we have received word from some hardy warriors that dared to traverse the dark lands that the Romans and Vikings are now making efforts to create a land bridge to our settlement. We must work to meet them for that is our only means to safety.
####
## Text 810 ##
Together with the Vikings we were able to prevent the Mayans from being crushed by the Dark Tribe. It was no great love for the Mayans that prompted us to help them. We have suffered enough injury at their hands. But the alternative is still worse. The Dark Tribe enslaves all Settlers that it captures and by doing so increases its strength at our cost. This cannot happen or all is lost.
The dreams of our priests continue and the importance of interpreting them correctly grows. The she-wolf is on a long journey and comes after some time to a long mountain chain. She seeks passage to cross the mountains but finds none. But during her search, she stops and pays heed to the low, eerie crawling sounds that waft across the cold, shadowy crevices. 
We are to embark on a journey where we will have to cross a mountain and confront the dark groveling beast in its own den. On this both priests and warriors agree.
####
## Text 811 ##
It has been a time of reassessment. We have considered the Romans and Vikings to be our chief adversaries and this still mysterious Dark Tribe to be an irritating distraction. We now know that the danger posed by this dark kingdom cannot be underestimated. It not only destroys the lands that it encompasses, but also transforms our peoples into mindless minions. Only with the help of the Romans and Vikings were we able to escape a fate that has filled us with a shudder of repulsion.
After our rescue, a new dream came to our priests where the jaguar crosses water and lands on an atoll. Here she is engaged in a terrible fight with another jaguar. How this fits in with our search for the dark domains is not yet clear. The priests have taken counsel and are convinced that the dark domains are beyond the atoll. This we will know soon enough. We will set sail as soon as possible.
####
## Text 812 ##
Breaking through to the Mayans was no easy matter, but finally we were able to join the land we regained with that of the Romans and the Mayans. The stone-builders were slow in recognizing how precarious their situation was and the magnitude of the threat posed by the Dark Ones. 
Dreams continue to visit our priests. In them, the bear comes to an area where he encounters a mirror-like object among a number of towers. He repeatedly hurls himself against this mirror. In the mirror the wolf, bear and jaguar can be seen only dimly, somehow distorted. It is clear to our priests that we will be meeting with resistance of some kind but they are not sure just what the mirror signifies. There can be no doubt that this will be clearer when we reach the area. The priests believe that the darkness we want to locate and banish forever is there. The time for talking is now at an end, the time for action begins.
####
## Text 813 ##
The dark dominions spread like a plague. They seem to be everywhere in the meantime. The Romans and Mayans should have gotten here by now, but there is still no sign of them. We cannot afford to wait for them. If we do not act soon, the Dark Tribe will be too strong for us all. There is a ray of hope. Our spies think they have located the final Dark Temple, and this could well be the heart of this dark domain. If we succeed in destroying it, perhaps we can succeed in freeing ourselves of them once and for all.
####
## Text 814 ##
We managed to defeat the Mayan pirates who were infesting the atoll before the mainland. Their ship building skills and marine presence were far more impressive and intimidating than we could have imagined. After defeating them, we were sure that we would find the seat of the Dark Tribe on the mainland, just beyond the atoll, but that was not the case.
Sometime after reaching the mainland, a great storm blew in, making further movement impossible for some days. We were fortunate not to have lost all of our ships.
We have learned that the Vikings had more luck, if that is the right word, in locating the Dark Presence. If our reports are accurate, they were able to take the Dark Temple. They were not able to wipe out the Dark Tribe completely. We must set sail for the area where the Vikings are said to be. If the same reports have reached the Romans, they will surely do the same. The final battle is brewing and will certainly make the recent storm seem harmless. Now all will be won or all will be lost.
####
## Text 815 ##
One of our Priests came back from the mountain lake in the north with a strange tale to tell: the Water Nymph who dwells in the lake will be well-disposed towards any race which builds twelve of the water-filled Eyecatchers in homage to her near the lake.
####
## Text 816 ##
We are fortunate in that our base is blessed with a plentiful supply of resources. There should certainly be enough available to recruit a healthy contingent of Gardeners and Bowmen.
####
## Text 817 ##
It would be unwise to try to capture the Dark Tribe's Temple at this stage. Instead we should focus on building up a strong army - the mountain to the south-west could well be home to valuable treasures of use here. Our troops will be needed to ensure the Gardeners' safety as they carry out their work.
####
## Text 818 ##
Time is of the essence. We must set about producing the tools and weapons we need to fulfill our mission as quickly as possible. We have to maintain our vigilance against Mayan attacks, and should concentrate our defences on a small number of Towers.
####
## Text 819 ##
We understand that our allies, the Vikings, would welcome a visit from one of our Priests at their main Marketplace. There could even be tangible rewards for us if we do them this honor. Our Pioneers will help us to obtain the glittering resources we need for this ambassadorial mission from the hills to the south.
####
## Text 820 ##
We should welcome every bit of help we can get with open arms. Didn't our spies say something about a pirate ship at the east coast? It would be interesting to know if it survived the storm in tact.
####
## Text 821 ##
There is danger in the air. We should think very carefully about how to preserve our Pioneers and Gardeners, and perhaps make use of their transformational abilities. It would be wise to concentrate our defenses on one Tower to begin with, and later to station our Bowmen to the north-east of the mountain.
####
## Text 822 ##
We should be very careful with our stone resources until we can access the deposits in the west. Instead of producing weapons, we should focus our attention on seafaring so that we can confront the Pirates who are at large on the waters. Maybe we can even get hold of some of their treasures...
####
## Text 823 ##
Examine the entire island in your search for the raw materials needed.
####
## Text 824 ##
Time is pressing and we are lacking the very things we need most: axes and saws! And we really need to strengthen our defenses so that we can fend off the waves of attacks which are certain to come. Our only hope lies in arranging our defenses in just the right way...
####
## Text 825 ##
You are safe from the Dark Tribe on your initial island. Don't delay your attack for too long, as the Dark Tribe wastes no time in becoming ever stronger.
####
## Text 826 ##
Don't forget the weapons and stone resources on the south-western island. Try not to let the confrontation drag on for too long. Guard yourself against the Shamans!

Stone for stone we have built our noble civilization. Our fields of corn reach as far as the eye can see. For generations we have tolerated no obstacles in the pursuit of our birthright. But now the eagle-beaked ones - Romans, they call themselves - have landed on our shores and now spread like a disease across our lands. Our stone and our wood they plunder for their strange dwellings. Even worse is their wanton greed for our gold. They must be driven back.
The jaguar is also among us. It came to our priests in visions, its ears flattened back and hissing. This vision is certainly a form of warning not only to the priests but to all the sons of our fathers before us. We must make ready for the Romans. May the blood of our forefathers course through our veins. May we exact a high price for the blood we shed.
####
## Text 2574 ##
The Romans have been vanquished, but a new threat has appeared - a tribe of giants with reddish beards. With serpents and reptiles embellishing the hilts of their polished swords, they plunge into battle, heedless of whatever fate awaits them. One among them, an axe-wielder, injured far too many of our warriors. We must be clever if we are to prevail.
In the jungle the eyes of the jaguar shine like gems. In the dreams of our priests, the glint of her eyes has been dulled. These eyes seek no prey but rather respite from something terrible. What does all this mean? First, we must attend to the red-beards, Vikings they call themselves. Let our blood mingle with the jaguar's that she again takes up the hunt, that we take up the hunt of the bearded giants.
####
## Text 2575 ##
It was no easy matter defeating the giants of the north. But they are now beat back like the Romans before them. Our spies have brought back reports of meetings between the Vikings and the Romans. We must expect that they are planning to join forces. The only advantage remaining to us is battle on home grounds …and, of course, our cunning. 
The priests continue to speak excitedly of the jaguar. Her dream gait is no longer the elegant one we know as she stealthily approaches her prey. Her tawny fur has lost its luster. Despite the distress this unleashes among our priests, we must turn our attention to the double threat confronting us.
####
## Text 2576 ##
Unfortunately the raw materials at the base of our settlement are a little thin on the ground. But we should not ignore the island to the south-east: it is home to large amounts of all the important ores.
####
## Text 2577 ##
The Vikings are tough opponents and it will be some time before our troops can rise to their challenge. Unless, that is, we find something on our island which will speed things up a little...
####
## Text 2578 ##
We should make the very most of our Pioneers' abilities. They are the key to securing the iron we need before we can venture into Roman and Viking territory. We are most likely to be rewarded if our Pioneers set off southwards.

Protect the new arrivals on the way to your settlement and organise a big feast for them! Bring 25 fish, 25 loaves of bread, 25 units of meat and 25 units of Tequila into the relevant camp before the Vikings reach your fortress.

In Olympia, sacrifice 16 bows, 16 swords, 16 blowguns and 16 gold bars to get manna to steal the Wonders of the World. Each spell costs 250 manna.
####
## Text 2678 ##
Your Priests must not die, because they still have the Wonders of the World in their pockets! Pick up your Level 3 Warriors at the Canaries, and don't leave your 3 squad leaders behind! Take the Priests and your Warriors by ship all the way to the southwest of the map.
####
## Text 2679 ##
Capture the castle and the sacred places occupied by hostile forces to obtain the Wonders of the World. Your Priests must not die, and 1 Priest must travel to each of these locations. Occupy the healing spring, build 1 Small Temple there. You need 300 manna to place a curse on the Wonders of the World...
####
## Text 2680 ##
The Gods be praised! We've taken the fortress. Now we must send the Priests to the sacred grounds for the Wonders of the World when we've captured these too!

The Vikings are sending another Ambassador. Nothing must go wrong this time, otherwise war will be inevitable!

####
## Text 2703 ##
The Mage's camouflage has been removed! We should go to him and ask what he desires.
####
## Text 2704 ##
The Trojans are building on a sacred ground and this is why I wanted to drive them out. But there is free, fertile land in the west. Help me to green up the cramped Dark Land in the east and I will help the Trojans to resettle.
####
## Text 2705 ##
The Mage has relocated the entire village in the area of the sacred site to the west.
####
## Text 2706 ##
The Mage seems to be weakened! He was unable to hold back the ship.
####
## Text 2707 ##
Thanks be to him! The Mage has moved all the buildings around the sacred place to neutral land.
####
## Text 2708 ##
The Gods, yes, the Gods... Our prayers have been answered: the Gods have come to us, they are the giants from whose heads horns of mighty bulls grow. We will prepare a feast for them, because they don't trust us earthbound beings, and must show them all the respect and honour that befits them, those who lift us worms from the soil.
But not all Mayans have such good intentions. The ungodly leader Gran Guerrero commands an army of inhuman savages who will slaughter anyone, really anyone, who comes too close to them. This time we must lead the Gods safely into battle and with all our courage. May the Gods bless us in the name of the holy cause...
####
## Text 2709 ##
The holidays at last! We have been brazen and God-fearing. The false Gods turned out to be friendly, travelling Vikings, tired of fighting and seeking some joy in their lives. All fear aside, we'll go to Europe. We want to marvel at nothing less than the Wonders of the World which have been much praised by the Vikings.
But we have received a desperate cry for help: A small Trojan settlement is the constant target of a Viking Mage called Barbarus Torgus. The peace he cannot find in his world he begrudges everyone else! He knows no mercy, even for these humble farmers...
####
## Text 2710 ##
They rise up in front of us: The Colossus of Rhodes and the Lighthouse of Alexandria! We are speechless as we gaze upon these monuments. Magnificent and sublime, they soar up in this part of the world and ennoble the people. But if we have no Gods, those who mock us should not be able to admire their Wonders of the World. Besides, they would look nice in our front garden. So, get to work: The Wonders of the World are ours! Glory be! They'll never get us...
####
## Text 2711 ##
Oh dear, oh dear! We must get away from here! We're being hunted like rabbits because now all the people know who has seized their Wonders of the World. They won't be nice to us... But we can't leave if our Priests aren't here. A natural barrier of reefs makes it impossible to sail to them. Let us pray for ourselves and for our Priests, so the Gods may be indulgent towards our brazen actions and enclose us in their protective embrace...
####
## Text 2712 ##
How could that happen? We were so dazzled by the Wonders of the World we didn't realise how difficult it would be to put these massive structures in a suitable location. Now we're here being pursued, hunted, harassed, we must search for a place where we can rid ourselves of these monuments.
The villains are getting closer. Strong Roman allies are said to have landed nearby and the only possible refuge is occupied by the Mayans, who hate us. It won't be easy to place a curse on the Wonders of the World among all this mayhem... If we do succeed, we promise never to steal the Wonders of the World or anything like that again!

Caesar's legions are on the march! Now our Emperor has decided he won't rule anything less than the world, we won't be able to stop the last belligerent Trojans. Only we shall emerge victorious from this battle!
But under no circumstances should we lose sight of our real objective: Under Erik the Red, the Vikings are back from America. They have found a Caribbean island kingdom in the west, near the so-called Gulf of Mexico, wherever that may be! The fleet we built in haste will win this race and we, the Romans, will claim this new land for Caesar and plant our SPQR standard firmly in the ground!
####
## Text 2768 ##
Allies! Why do we Romans need allies? We are the mightiest power in this struggle between the peoples. Caesar will reward us richly for the new land in the Caribbean. We don't care how we achieve victory in the boat race, even if it means we have to eliminate our allies in the most uncivil of ways. But what do we care? We want to win! Warning: we must not be discovered! That's why this time we won't announce we're on the warpath...
####
## Text 2769 ##
This is the revenge of the Gods for the sabotage we committed! Lost in an unknown island area, we are suffering from a severe water shortage. There is unrest among the legionnaires, and a mutiny may be brewing. There is gold in the mountains, we know that, but gold will not quench our thirst! Without a source of drinking water this will surely be the end for us...
####
## Text 2770 ##
Oh, Gods! Why do you insist on punishing us? A violent storm blew up and our fleet has been destroyed! Our people are scattered to a thousand winds... Now let us reflect on our virtues: discipline and strength. We will build a new settlement, our economy will become a role model. But how can we compensate for the loss of the fleet? We must win the race! A small reconnaissance patrol has discovered a fleet in an enemy bay. This is an excellent opportunity to obtain the ships we need...
####
## Text 2771 ##
These stupid Maya! We can't believe what our Scout has reported to us. They've stolen no less than two of the Wonders of the World! Should our European culture be destroyed by these feathered savages? We'll know how to prevent that and will stand in the way of anyone who opposes us. We're facing the challenge of the battle once again, but we must focus all our attention: A healing spring makes our enemies strong, so let's make it unusable by destroying the temple. We will obtain the spring with one of our Temples at this place, because only without the spring the Mayans can be defeated, and only then will their mighty castle fall like a straw in the storm...
####
## Text 2772 ##
More than one site is suitable for a port... But watch out: All these areas are in enemy hands!

Stay away from the Towers! An invincible fleet has secured the harbour. You have to must sneak over the island from behind. An attack would alert your fellow combatants immediately, but under no circumstances should you destroy the ferries!

Beware the Mayan patrols! Monitor your resources closely.

Use catapults to destroy the Big Towers right by the Wonders of the World! But beware: The Mayans have a healing spring, but with your own Small Temple at this location your Soldiers can draw power from the spring.

The Village of the Eleven Sacred Towers@Hear the words of the Priest and fulfil the missions you are ready to attempt. Protect the Eleven Sacred Towers in our settlement, not a single one may be destroyed.@Greetings stranger! The village where we live was once the favourite place of the Gods! Odin, his wife Frigg and his sons Thor, Vidar, Vali, Hödr, and Hermodr are said to have spoken to our ancestors here before retiring to the realms of heaven, Hlidskjalf. They created eleven high towers which were aligned with the stars. For us, these towers are the most sacred things we possess. This is what the inhabitants of the western "Island of Guardians" say...
Some time ago, a friendly Roman tribe settled in the north of our island. Since then, we have been engaged in extensive trade with our new friends, who have no beards. Thanks to Odin, our humble people can flourish in peace. Our women are happy and bear us many sons, of whom we are very proud...
Only Olec, whom they call the "Cruel", is a cause for concern; he has always been a reclusive loner who has withdrawn to his castle in the east. But now we have not heard from him for a long time. However, a new people seems to have settled in the southwest. We will soon send a Scout to inform us of the new arrivals. An envoy of the "Keepers of the Towers" awaits you in the south. Listen carefully to what he has to report...
####
## Text 2786 ##
Your own Soldiers are the best! Never rely on any others...

## Text 2787 ##
Ruler! Hear what I have to report! Evil princes have spread. Show your mettle and cross the line when you are ready to rise to the challenge!

## Text 2788 ##
Bold and brave my king! Help the Romans in the north by supplying weapons until help arrives in 2 hours. Your glory will be great!
####
## Text 2789 ##
Do you have even more faith in yourself? Then cross the next line, and manna will be released all over the island and the magic power of all Priests will be increased!
####
## Text 2790 ##
But remember: The spell also makes your enemies stronger!
####
## Text 2791 ##
You appear to have supreme self-confidence, great ruler! Destroy Olec the Cruel, who enslaved a Mayan people to protect himself.
####
## Text 2792 ##
If you dare to pass through the flames, you get 40 weapons... If you survive! Your chances are 1:1, so think carefully!
####
## Text 2793 ##
What good luck! If you believe that you can defeat even Hermes the Coward, then cross this line too. There will also be a surprise for you.
####
## Text 2794 ##
Luck is not on your side this time! My surprise magic has no effect. Unfortunately both Hermes and Olec received 40 Warriors!

## Text 2843 ##
Oh, Gods! Why do you allow us to suffer? Our homeland Troy, the cradle of our culture, is in ruins. You have allowed the Romans to storm this once mighty stronghold...
Flight is the only way left open to us. But this flight shall not be our end, it offers us the unique opportunity to deploy our scientific superiority to finally emerge victorious! The foolhardy Vikings have challenged all the nations to a boat race, with an uncharted Caribbean island kingdom in the west as the reward for the winner. But we'll make much faster progress to our destination because we know the Earth is round! He who laughs last...
####
## Text 2844 ##
Oh, these Roman dogs! We were able to escape the storm they unleashed in their attack on Troy, but not their intrigues! Sabotage is the only way the Romans can win the race. And we had made good progress travelling west to America...
But now we're stranded on an uncharted island without a single ship. How are we supposed to build a new fleet out of this miserable refuge? But our collapsed economy doesn't appear to be the only evil we have to fight: this island is eerie. Strange figures flit through the night and we hear terrible noises. What awaits us here? Is this the end?
####
## Text 2845 ##
The new fleet is now built and full of confidence, we're back in the race to the unexplored land in the west! An island world unfolds before us, unknown and exotic, populated by a people that built elaborate stone heads in honour of the gods.
Perhaps this will give us the opportunity to replenish our food supplies... The construction of these huge stone heads uses vast amounts of stone, and the stone deposits of the island people are dwindling. This is the precisely the right moment to trade with the Mayans: We are experts in mining, we can mine stone for hundreds of these stone monuments, while the Mayans prosper and want to thank the Gods. The Maya's thanksgiving ritual is approaching, so let's go, Trojans, let's hit some rocks!
####
## Text 2846 ##
A gateway! We need a gateway! Not just any one... We received a clue about a magic portal that could enable us to gain some ground in this boat race between peoples, because it's meant to get the brave souls who have dared to venture thus far one step closer to America!
But we have to find the magic place on this unexplored island to enable us to take advantage of this in the game. A first outpost has been built, and all we have to do now is to wait for our main ship which will transport the raw materials we need urgently. However, we must proceed with caution because, as we know already, the portal is guarded by strong Roman units...
####
## Text 2847 ##
The brave shall be rewarded! Our step through the magic gateway has paved the way to a new world. Pure magic has given us wings and victory in the race is within our grasp. We are now faced with another test, and must find the second magic portal. It is said to be hidden in the mighty peaks towering above us and guarded by wild Mayan tribes. Not everyone is welcome, and we will need to select our negotiator very carefully, because the Mayans will show the appropriate respect to a skilled and highly decorated Warrior from our ranks...

Erik the Red knows exactly how to keep us happy! We haven't become get fat and lazy - the fighting blood in our veins is too fiery. But a little change after all the conquests and battles will do no harm. It is important that we enjoy ourselves and have fun to keep boredom at bay! But this work of the devil Erik has challenged all the nations to a boat race, and the prize for the winner is the undiscovered land in the Caribbean. Summer, sun, sand, all our own barren and cold land cannot offer. The lure is fabulous! But first we have to reach our home and regain our strength. The exploration of America was exhausting. So, you old seadogs, we're entering the race and will defy every challenge... Danger is our middle name!
####
## Text 2896 ##
By Odin! Not only have we become fat and lazy, but we are now ruled by stupidity. Nobody seems able to think properly anymore, the entire crossing was one continuous drinking binge. And we have precisely the right thing for this excess: tons of mead. We were able to defy the tides of the sea. But not a single crust of bread can be found on this floating tavern. That doesn't help: We must sober up and find food. We've heard rumours that a Mage in these lands can turn mead into food. If we don't want to produce fish, bread and meat ourselves, we could try to bring our mead to the wise man, because we have plenty of it... If we don't pull ourselves together we'll perish in this godless place!
####
## Text 2897 ##
What a party! We really pushed the boat out. There's no stone left standing. Our new enemy is now called a headache, and even the old miracle remedies of our Mayan friends have no affect... But this Mayan festival had its benefits as far as we're concerned, because now our enemies have been unmasked in their own ranks: thieves of Roman origin were going to sabotage our fun boat race at every opportunity! But the rogues were quickly identified at this feast. They have already fallen flat on their faces after just one barrel of mead! This is unworthy of a true Norseman...
####
## Text 2898 ##
These Maya really make us laugh. Not only did they take us for Gods in their god delusion, they have now sacrificed the last remnants of their minds to alcohol, and we seized the chance to steal a treasure map. We simply couldn't resist the temptation! Because the treasure map indicates a secret island on which only women live in a fabled place. The women are very beautiful, and a Warrior's heart knows immediately that this is precisely where it is needed. Let the other ignorant idiots make fools of themselves in the boat race, while we'll trim our beards and embark on a journey into paradise...
####
## Text 2899 ##
The mysterious island actually exists, but we haven't seen any women yet. It will be impossible to explore the entire island. In front of us a mighty wall of fire has appeared, that does not seem to be of this world. The way to the interior of the island is therefore barred. How can we penetrate this firewall? Well, we don't know yet, but the idea of flocks of fragrant, beautiful women is a very, very good incentive to stimulate the grey matter!

The wise ones have told us about this holy place. According to legend, the gods will be pleased if we create a meat farm in their honor on this site.
####
## Text 2912 ##
Move 200 units of meat into storage!
####
## Text 2913 ##
We have succeeded in producing 200 units of meat. In gratitude, the gods have given us manna. We can now make use of the meat.
####
## Text 2914 ##
Hello, can you help me? My valuable amulet was stolen by the barbaric Vikings. Can you get it back for me?
####
## Text 2915 ##
Return the amulet to the priest by finding the enemy temple and destroying it!
####
## Text 2916 ##
Thank you for returning my amulet to me. To show my gratitude, I will show you the way to a treasure.
####
## Text 2917 ##
Oh no! Thor is furious because we have defeated people under his protection. He has brought our entire wood production to a standstill. Never pick a quarrel with the gods...
####
## Text 2918 ##
We come from another island. We Romans should stick together to defeat the Mayans.

You have made it through all the missions on the SETTLERS IV MISSION CD. Congratulations!

Oh no! We can't finish all our jobs!

Rome no longer overshadows us! We are busy and the settlement fills us all with pride. A road marks the way to a flat territory to the north. There lies a suitable site for a productive hog farm. Our diligent workers should never again have to suffer the pangs of hunger! And the gods will show their appreciation for the sacrifices made there!
During this period of productivity, a reconnaissance patrol reports meeting an old hermit priest named Majus. Majus was attacked by the hordes of Torgus. This Viking horde, which will stop at nothing, stole from him the source of his power: a valuable amulet! The barbarians have carried the amulet off to their temple. Majus begs us to help him. Let us show him that we are men of honor and start the hunt for Torgus!

Our settlement is growing steadily, and that must remain our central goal. Our strength must grow and we must become great. We will have to win great battles against the Vikings and the Mayans. But without a well-organized settlement, victory will never be ours!
The land to the North is ruled by a fierce Viking tribe. Scouts have reported that there is a land route to that place which is open to us. The attack will therefore proceed by land. But our priests also report the existence of a tribe of Mayans that is steeped in legend. In their visions, the priests see the land of the Mayans, in all its splendor, to the West. New, fertile settlements could flourish there, honoring Jupiter, but the great ocean lies between us. We must build ships before we can start the campaign against the Mayans. May the gods reward us with a great victory!
####
## Text 3018 ##
Our enemies, the Romans, have grown strong: two strong settlements are threatening our freedom. Only one of the scouts we sent out has returned so far. He was able to report another Mayan settlement to the Southeast. However, they are not friendly towards us. His attempt to make peaceful contact failed miserably. Only through bold flight was he able to save his own life. These Mayans don't want to share the Holy Tree with anybody!
The priests see the Great Jaguar. He is pacing restlessly back and forth. He must be appeased. We must conquer the Holy Tree in the Southeast. Only then will we be assured of his protection in the future. But the campaign must start by forcing the strong Roman alliances to their knees--their settlements lie between us and the Holy Tree. The battle for the Holy Tree begins!
####
## Text 3019 ##
We must thank the gods for the fat years. Odin's ravens led our priests to a holy place. There, we built temples honoring the gods, who favor and protect us. For a long time, we lived in the belief that this place remained our best-kept secret. But the insidious Gundalf betrayed this holy place to our enemies. The blasphemers destroyed the temples! Gundalf was unable to enjoy his ill-acquired riches for long as Odin´s fury took him off to the land of the dead! But the blasphemers have not yet sinned...
Our reconnaissance troops have already located the enemy settlements. They are Romans and Mayans. The settlements are difficult to capture. Our enemies are protected by massive mountain ranges. The passes are narrow and well guarded. But with Odin's help, Thor's Hammer will crush the enemies, and our warriors will be victorious!

The Holy Mother Earth is good to us. Our settlements are blossoming. But it has been a long time since Thor swung his War Hammer. Much time has passed since we last departed on an adventure to explore foreign lands. Our warriors fear they are turning into old washerwomen.
The priests, however, sing another tune. They tell us tales of fertile land under a southern sun. Adventure beckons. Let us build new ships; let us depart for strange shores!
####
## Text 3057 ##
Our fleet is at sea and finally we are exploring new land. Soon the southern sun will be kissing our northern souls and filling us with a thirst for action. Several islands look inviting.
Before us lies the legendary island kingdom of the Fat Earth. In the distance, we can see four islands. Which one should be our first target? Will we run into hostile settlements or find new friends? Could a new home be waiting for us in the southern sunlight? Let us be off to the promised land!
####
## Text 3058 ##
This wonderful country has pleased us. It almost looks like we have found a homeland. A mighty mountain range stretches before us. We are adventurers; we want to explore all of this land. So it is essential for us to first conquer these mountains before we build a harbor on the other side of the island. Our priests called upon Odin, our highest god. In their dream, he sent out both his ravens. They brought information about a strange, well-defended settlement. Odin looked concerned. The priests are now calling upon the legendary warrior Beowulf and asking him to fill our warriors' hearts with all his courage. A fight seems unavoidable!
####
## Text 3059 ##
Our ships have brought us to new land. This island would be a good place for a flourishing settlement. For the explorers have recently discovered the remains of a strange, advanced civilization. But we don't know whether the feather-wearing foreigners moved on to discover new lands or were defeated by the Romans, who are so experienced in the art of battle.
The priests' visions bring ominous tidings. They say that our people will not live in peace on this ground. Odin's ravens are flying angry circles in the sky. A fight with the Romans living on one of the islands can no longer be avoided. Our warriors' hearts have been lifted and inspired by the spirit of Beowulf. We must go to war. As long as Romans are settling here, the fire of battle will blaze with great heat!
####
## Text 3060 ##
We have reached a large, fertile island. We seem to have found our new home. Our new settlement will flourish here; we want to make our ancestors proud.
But we are not the only arrivals on this glorious corner of the earth. Scouts report that Roman and also Mayan settler groups have landed here as well. The priests have conveyed Odin's wise advice to us. In their dreams, he spoke of a mighty castle at the heart of the island. We will have to build this castle, because it is essential that we defeat all our enemies. Thus, Thor's Hammer will have to swing again, before the land is ours!
####
## Text 3061 ##
The fjords in the West are well suited for the construction of a shipyard. Near the fjords, you find rich deposits of raw materials. Whatever you do, try not to get involved in the battles.
####
## Text 3062 ##
There is a deserted island to the North. Look there for a location for a settlement. Using the pioneers, annex enough land to build on. Then send the pioneers into the new land and convert them to carriers, builders, and diggers.
####
## Text 3063 ##
A mighty mountain range is protecting our enemies. If you manage to hack out an access path, you will be exposing yourself to the danger of an attack!
####
## Text 3064 ##
Guard your coasts against the roman attacks! Do not be too premature in attacking the well-defended main base on the other island !
####
## Text 3065 ##
Quickly conquer the mountain to the East! Recruit your soldiers early!

The fight against the Dark People has cost us a great deal of our strength. Our settlement is now lying almost entirely in smoking ruins. We are however in good spirits because the petrification of Morbus has given us enough strength to gaze with hope at our future. Our scouts have also brought us good news of rich deposits of raw material near us. Our settlement will become an advanced civilization again.
One day, however, a traveling peddler arrived in our settlement and brought horrible news: He had only barely been able to escape the Dark People's pursuers. While fleeing, he lost all his possessions. He was even able to tell us about areas of the Dark Country that haven't yet been settled by the Dark People. Now, we are certain that our future will not consist solely of a life lived in peace. Despite the petrification of Morbus, the danger from the Darkness has not been eliminated. If we do not defend ourselves, the Darkness will fall upon our land like a disease. However, there is one gleam of hope: We are not alone in this battle. Our lookouts recently noticed small settlements of Vikings and Mayans. They also know about the threat posed by the Dark Forces and want to ally themselves with us unconditionally for the fight.
####
## Text 3179 ##
All our efforts to expand our settlement and increase our strength for our next meeting with the Dark People have only led to this: The Dark People now see us as a fat target that would be worth the taking. Despite our alliances, the Dark Threat is growing around us. We are gradually losing more and more land and settlers. Jupiter seems to have abandoned us; our appeals have not yet found favor with him.
The Roman art of war alone will not save us from the Dark People, who are steadily expanding. We must risk a retreat. Scouts have already informed us that they have discovered a small, effective unit of fertile land, and that they could take possession of it. The description of the land lets us hope for a colony that can be defended easily. The retreat will be dangerous. We will have to cross the desert. The Dark People will not rest until they have captured every single one of us. We are praying to the gods. May our plea awaken their mercy. May our allies not forget us.

Our gratitude to the gods. Our retreat was successful. The new colony has made us strong. We have already been able to create three more settlements in the surrounding land. They are slowly blossoming. We are helping each other, and no one is alone. The future is smiling upon us.
Nevertheless, recent news from the scouts have shocked us to the core. Will we ever find peace? The Dark People are not far from here. They are expanding in the heart of the land, between our four settlements. Their fighting strength is increasing. The Dark People will attack us, annexing the small, growing settlements, and the Darkness will come. However, we are going to fight. The settlements alone are weak. They have no protection against the superior Dark forces. Our fate lies in a united fight. All of us together will defy the Darkness. May the gods stand on our side.
####
## Text 3181 ##
We are the favorites of the gods. This strength-draining fight was not for nothing. We are now free of the threat posed by the Dark People. Our settlement is strong.
Our fight against the Dark People has made us vigilant. Our allies, however, seem to have forgotten the Dark threat. A flourishing settlement cannot be left undefended. But that is just what the Viking ambassadors are reporting. One of their settlements will fall prey to the Dark threat if we do not hurry to their aid. We are ready. After all, to battle our worst enemy is important. However, traveling to the Vikings will be very dangerous. We have heard about strong groups of Mayan pirates. These devils have allied themselves with the forces of Darkness and are falling upon the land like a plague of locusts. We must dare to break through them. May the gods continue to regard us as their favorites.
####
## Text 3182 ##
The suspicion has become a certainty. Peace will not enter our lives as long as survivors of the Dark People can mob together to form new settlements. Our allies confirm what our scouts discovered long before: The Dark People are gathering in the gloomy swamps of the forests of night. There, under the cover of Darkness, some strong Dark settlements have already been created by the few Dark survivors.
Mars is calling us to engage in this decisive battle! All the Roman fighting courage that we can bring together will not suffice for the task. The Dark People have become too strong. Only with the help of the allied Vikings and Mayans will we be able to create an army that can overcome the Dark threat. We know that the fight will require everything we have; we will have to conquer strong Dark settlements in the middle of the dim swamp of the forests of the night. Sound the battle trumpets! May all the gods of war form powerful alliances with us mortals!

Peace has entered our lives. Our settlement is becoming lively, and we continue expanding it. Jupiter must be smiling on us! We should make a sacrifice in his honor. We want to keep his kindness in the future as well.
A legend has been circulating since the start of our settlement. The Old Ones speak of a legendary treasure located in the Southwest. Immeasureable in size, entire cities could be built out of its gold. It is essential that we find this treasure to guarantee Jupiter's happiness for all time.

The gods are with us. The great Jaguar god seems to be appeased. The priests say that in their visions they can perceive him resting peacefully in the jungle. The rain god Chac and our corn god Yumkaax also are feeling pleased. Our fields produce rich harvests, and no one has to hunger. We are able to expand our settlements. An advanced civilization is growing.
Our friends, however, are doing poorly. A Viking ambassador arrived half-starved in our settlement and bore tidings of a bad drought that has brought the Viking settlement into dire straits. He requests our aid, that we leave as soon as possible with food and raw materials to connect our land with the Viking settlements to the Northwest. While considering whether we should go or not, our thoughts return to a long forgotten legend that we believed in. Our ancestors spoke of a mighty Viking priest living the life of a hermit on an island in the Southwest. Anyone who finds him will be rewarded with large amounts of manna! However, the way to his island is difficult. Dangerous snow areas will have to be conquered. But thinking about the reward makes us ready to take on the challenge!
####
## Text 3213 ##
The help of our friends, the Mayans, came at a divinely determined hour, as the drought's catastrophe could be prevented. We are recovering slowly but steadily.
The priests know that this miracle could only have happened with the gods' help. They are making a sacrifice in Thor's honor. It will take place during the solstice, for the priests say that the gods are closest to us at this time.

Welcome to the demo for THE SETTLERS IV!  It's a terrible thing when it comes to this. Our own brothers have turned against us and seem determined to carry on this absurd feud. All attempts at solving the conflict peacefully have come to nothing, and it seems that we have no option but to take up arms against our own flesh and blood. There are also rumors that a mysterious people is at work behind the mountains, but we do not yet know if they also pose a danger to us. One thing is quite clear, however, we must be prepared for battle against our fellow Vikings.

Objective: Destroy the Viking settlement in the north-east.

Nasty Surprise@ Defeat both Vikings and conquer the Mayan holy place!@We were so close to victory...
Our catapults were standing ready to deliver the decisive blow against the Mayan fortresses. But suddenly the heavens turned black and a terrible storm broke over us. Our army was destroyed. Fortunately, the catapults were not damaged. But now they are standing before a white, impenetrable wall. We cannot move forward. And new bad news has just arrived: An eerie force has trapped our builders and diggers in a crater.

Bahlum-Kuk@Win back your gold treasure. To do this, destroy the Mayans' pyramids and take over the stone circle on the Island of the Dead!@The notorious Mayan King Bahlum-Kuk stormed our western provinces with his wild hordes. He plundered the rich main city, and then disappeared as quickly as he had come. He carried off almost our entire gold stores!

Fishermen reported to us that a terrible storm broke out just as the Mayans were sailing away with their stolen plunder. And afterward, the fishermen discovered wooden planks, broken masts, and sailcloth on the beaches of the numerous islands in these waters. The Mayans' ships apparently fell victim to the storm!

But was our gold lost forever? Or had some of the plunderers been able to save their lives and their loot? To find out, the Caesar sent me into Mayan territory with a small expeditionary force. Unaware that we were already very close to their settlements, we started building a base camp. Suddenly we discovered one of their warriors trying to spy on us! In view of our superior forces, he betrayed the hiding place of the treasure: The looters have hidden a large portion of the gold in the Mayan pyramids! But the rest was said to still be on the island where the Mayans buried their dead after the great storm...
####
## Text 3335 ##
The Romans have very few construction materials and tools. So think well about the sequence in which you want to build the settlement!

Camelot@Drive the invaders from British soil!@A few weeks ago, the knights of the Round Table were victorious in battle against Mordred's troops. But the price for this victory was high: Shortly after the struggle, King Arthur succumbed to his injuries.
We prepared a magnificent burial ceremony, but on the day of the funeral it turned out that the body had disappeared...

The Viking prince Erik is now trying to take advantage of the unfavorable situation and has surrounded Camelot with six armies. Many of our knights have fallen or have not yet healed their wounds. Therefore, the remaining men must fight the more fiercely, to keep the mighty sword Excalibur from falling into enemy hands.

Conspiracy@Take over the entire map!@The brightly lit barbarian camp lay before us. Wild singing echoed through the night. We hoped that the strangers hadn't noticed our presence. Near the great fire, we could see the members of three different tribes. They seemed to be negotiating something, and to be in disagreement.
Further to the north, our scouts could see another camp, but we don't know anything about its inhabitants. Could this fourth camp have been the source of the quarrel?
On the next day we found out that our presence had not gone unnoticed, because only one of our scouts returned home. He was seriously wounded. We are now girding ourselves for the battles to come...
####

Dark Thunder@Escape from the crater and take over the settlements belonging to Cacau, Bahlum-Kuk, and K'an Zu!@We were sailing on the sea in the best of weather, when, suddenly, complete darkness filled the sky at noon. Shortly thereafter we were struck by an enormous storm. We were taken by surprise and became disoriented; our only aim was to save our own lives while the furious hurricane drove us before it. The rain whipped us and the wind howled like the voices of lost souls calling for us. No one knows anymore how long the storm played its game with us or whether our will to live would have broken if we had not had our priests along on board the ships. But even their support did not prevent our ships from being lifted from the ocean. As we rose up into the air, we lost consciousness...

When we awoke, the physical pain told us that we must still be alive. But where were we?
Around us rose gigantic mountains. Here there was neither food nor water, and so we were forced to find a way out of the crater in order to survive. On top of everything else, there seem to be hostile natives in this place. Our scouts bring us reports of bronze-skinned men wearing strange feather decorations...

Lano Estacado@Conquer the oasis in Lano Estacado! Find the Stone Cross and annex the entire atoll! Destroy the Viking castle and the Mayan Pyramids as well!@Centuries ago, the native inhabitants, a Mayan people, were driven away by strange seafarers. They were not prepared to deal with the sudden invasion of the Viking hordes! Only one priest was able to escape, at the last minute, in a boat. He buried this treasure on a small, hidden atoll surrounded by treacherous reefs, and he raised a stone cross in that place!

We discovered this secret in an old scroll. Driven by the desire to find the legendary treasure, we embarked upon the search for the atoll with the stone cross...

After months of searching at sea, we came to an island. This had to be the correct island! At its heart, we found a great desert that matched our description. The path through the desert was marked with stone columns to keep travelers from getting lost. This was the source of the area's name--Lana Estacado!

Inside the desert there was a wonderfully beautiful oasis. Here, we were supposed to find the directions that would bring us to the actual goal of our travels: the small atoll that was the resting place of such a large treasure--marked by a stone cross!

But the Mayans and the Vikings had also heard about this treasure! They tried to get to the oasis before us! The Mayans lived to the south of the desert, and Vikings had landed in the eastern part of the island. The Viking presence was impressive: They had built strong fortresses on a small peninsula! We were armed, however, and prepared to fight a mighty battle to win this legendary treasure!
####
## Text 3345 ##
Spread out as quickly as possible and take over the peninsula to the North! You will only be able to find gold to the Northwest of the great desert! You must secure this area before the Mayans get to it!

Limes@Defeat the Vikings and the Romans!@The Vikings have attacked us in our own land, looting our merchant ships, and then sinking them. They fled without engaging us in battle, but we were able to follow them unseen.
The Vikings landed in two places. We ourselves landed not far away and founded a settlement. We sent out scouts immediately, who brought back reports of a holy graveyard. As is the custom for the Norsemen, every fallen warrior's grave contained his weapon. This place is now said to be cursed, and every stranger who enters it is said to bitterly regret having done so...

Our reconnaissance troops caught sight of the defensive lines of another people behind a wall to the North. They were unable to penetrate further into the land's interior without being discovered. Before the fortifications however, there lies a strange crater, which the natives say has awesome powers...
####
## Text 3347 ##
Take care not to steal the weapons from the Viking graveyard! A head in the center, surrounded by fire, will bring healing blessings!

Magic_Barbarian@Conquer the Holy Mountain!@Our scout Tertius just got back. He reports that our wine caravan never arrived at the holy site to the Northeast. Furthermore, our holy harbor has been destroyed by brown-skinned warriors.
Raffael, the highest priest of Jupiter, sent us news from his island. "Oh followers of Jupiter, terrible things are happening on our holy island. The temples of Jupiter are collapsing for reasons we cannot ascertain. For weeks now, no new shipments of goods have reached us. Please send us sacrifices and a few builders to reconstruct the temples. The entrance to our main island has been destroyed by an earthquake. The only way in to the iron deposits has been taken over by dark-skinned warriors!"

Meteors@Defeat All Enemies!@Three legions have landed on this island to drive back the common, feather-decorated enemy. But little time had passed before a bizarre, aggressive tension developed among our own legions.

Suddenly, our own countrymen attacked us. A group of scouts reported meteorite strikes to the Northwest of our position. In some nearby mountains, there is said to have been a particularly large meteorite strike, and gold is said to be lying around there on the ground. But they are very strange stones, near which the spirit grows increasingly aggressive...
Further to the North, the group discovered a ruined city in a wasteland beyond a large swamp.The inhabitants must have fought against each other, because the city was completely destroyed. But no evidence whatsoever could be found of an outside attack.

East of this place, you saw at least three different Mayan tribes in the distance, all of which having an astounding number of priests at their disposal. Eternal fire burned around their shrines, and it appears that they have collected stones that are similar to those that confused our brothers' senses.

We must take possession of these stones!
####

Place your greatest emphasis on the production of manna! Well-filled storehouses will help you to survive in times of need. Smite the enemy with Jupiter's lightning bolts!

Papillion@Take back the holy island and destroy the Mayan temples@During a great banquet feast with the Omecs, these foul traitors suddenly drew their weapons and attacked us. In one fell swoop, they took over our holy island. A portion of my men were able to escape to this deserted settlement. During our flight, we passed near a Roman settlement and the foolish youth Teto killed a sentry. I am afraid that the Romans will want to avenge this deed. To make our escape possible, we left a small troop behind us.

We had scarcely arrived in this abandoned settlement when our buildings were threatened by hostile spies. They approach silently and make the buildings collapse. They are so quick about their evil work that the inhabitants are not even able to flee and save themselves.

The wise adviser Chico suggested taking the spies' work out of their hands. When I at last understood what the old fox meant, I could not suppress a grin.
A ship filled with craftsmen and some construction materials they bring with them has arrived in the Southwest portion of the island.

A scout reported that the Omecs have joined forces with the Aztecs. We will punish the Aztecs by destroying their temples. We will put the traitorous Omecs to flight!
####
## Text 3353 ##

SearchForMjoelnir@Annex the three holy sites and drive away the hostile peoples!@At a feast, Thor's half-brother Loki bewitched Odin with the help of a magical substance. When all eyes were on the paralyzed Father of the Gods, Loki was able to steal Thor's Hammer. This robbed Thor of his power so that Thor was unable to help Odin.

Since Loki cannot control the power of the Hammer, he has hidden it under an enormous cliff of rock. But, even here, the incredible power of Thor's Hammer won´t be suppressed. Although the Hammer is no longer able to return to its owner, it provides clear clues as to its hiding place!

The God of Thunder finds refuge with us and asks you, Espen of Falcon Isle, to help him in the quest to find his Hammer. Thor was additionally able to tell us that Loki has also hidden the three ingredients for the antidote in three locations near the Hammer.
Keep in mind that only priests of Odin can free the hammer from its prison. Secure the coal mountain before the Mayans get to it.

Settle Down@Defeat the Vikings and the Mayans!@The coast is an inhospitable area; we could not stay there. There was no water and no fertile land. Scouts reported finding a basin-shaped valley that was said to have better conditions. We set out.

On the way, another scout reported to us that his group had been attacked without reason. Only by hiding himself had he been able to escape. The strangers' warriors were dark-skinned and richly decorated with feathers. This group also ran across some Vikings whose hostile attitude toward us was unmistakeable.

It looks like we will have to defeat two enemies.

The few scouts who were able to return from the first reconnaissance patrol brought reports of great, bearded warriors whose hostile attitude toward us is unmistakable. May your courage and your determination be sufficient for you to conclude your search successfully... and to survive!

The enemy castle is very well fortified!

Surrounded@Defeat all the enemies!@The Roman commander so celebrated in tales and songs has now grown old and weak! A renegade group of Romans took advantage of the favorable hour. With the support of the Mayan people and two Viking tribes, to whom they promised gold and power, they attacked immediately...

Despite a heroic fight, the faithful Romans were almost defeated in the great battle! Boxed in, and desperately threatened by four hostile tribes, the last survivors are now waiting for the enemy's final, decisive attack! Is there a way out of the trap?
####
## Text 3361 ##
Try to overcome the desert patrols by using fast surprise attacks! A mountain rich in raw materials awaits you in the North! And obtain a route to the ocean--ships will prove very helpful on this mission...

## Text 3362 ##
The Cross@Conquer the Holy Cross of the West!@It's a disgrace! Our own brothers are refusing us access to the holy shrines. We must expand our territory westwards until the cross is part of the area under our control. When the shrine belongs to our state, we will be able to ensure that believers can visit the holy site whenever they like.
####
## Text 3363 ##
The terrain is very inhospitable. Pioneers are very valuable here! Building sites must be selected with care!
####
## Text 3364 ##
Conquer the entire Viking settlement in the west of the island.
####
## Text 3365 ##
Demonstrate your might by destroying the Small Temple surrounded by statues on the south-east coast of the Mayan land.
####
## Text 3366 ##
Make the Vikings' and Mayans' sacred grounds your own. You can tell the Vikings' holy place by the crystal-glazed entrance to a cave with a statue of a warrior standing guard. The Mayans' sacred spot is guarded by a large, ornate stone head.

We have been too complacent. Our discipline has dissipated with the absence of any serious rivals. This cannot and will not continue. Our spies have become aware that the Vikings have established a colony on the island. A fierce and proud tribe. They have apparently been industrious for they have built up thriving mining operations and flourishing farms. We will need more reconnaissance.  We must know their weaknesses, not only their strengths. 
Our priests are disquieted. They speak anxiously of a dream that has visited not one but several of them - an identical dream. The she-wolf of the Tiber appears, her head lowered and snarling.  It is not yet clear what this portends. But first we must prepare for meeting the threat of the Vikings.
####
## Text 3374 ##
We have managed to subdue the plundering tribe of the north. Many of our younger recruits have first blood on their swords and shields. Exhilaration and fatigue take their turns. We have no time to recoup our strength. Another tribe, a bronzed people, has appeared in the south. Some of our thieves were unpleasantly surprised by their stealth. May Jupiter steel our strength and resolve to overcome this new threat.
Oddly, the dreams of our priests continue. In them the she-wolf runs from place to place, rarely finding an opportunity to curl and lie down. Our priests are still stymied by these visions.
####
## Text 3375 ##
We have succeeded in beating back first the Vikings and then the Mayans. But what have we gained by our efforts? The two tribes have now allied themselves in the hope that what they were unable to accomplish alone, they can accomplish together. Our soldiers are stronger and more experienced with two battles behind them. But victory can only be ours if our planning and coordination are flawless and Fortuna smiles upon us.
The she-wolf is agitated. The priests report that she is ever on the prowl, her flanks mangy and reeking of decay. This dream certainly augurs ill. We must be prepared for the worst.
####
## Text 3376 ##
We have a ship at our disposal from the very beginning. A little bit of surveillance work in the west certainly wouldn't do any harm...
####
## Text 3377 ##
If marching straight through the Mayans' territory seems to be a little too dangerous, maybe there are other ways to reach the Mayan temple...

Welcome to the tutorial for THE SETTLERS IV. This text window explains the individual tasks which await you, while the lower window contains the instructions themselves.
####
## Text 3388 ##
If you do happen to get a bit lost at any stage during the tutorials, simply left-click on this text window and you will be returned to your starting point.
####
## Text 3389 ##
In order to complete the tutorial successfully, you should make sure that you read the texts in these windows very carefully. Simply follow the instructions and you'll be fine!
####
## Text 3390 ##
If you want to quit a mission, simply hit the "Esc" key and then confirm your choice when the prompt appears. You may also find the F12 key useful during the tutorial missions: it allows you to jump forward by one minute.
####
## Text 3391 ##
Now move the camera to the Snowman in the west of your settlement.
####
## Text 3392 ##
Let's take a look at how we move the camera first. Start off by pressing down the right mouse button (RMB). Then move the mouse without releasing the button.
####
## Text 3393 ##
Good! But you can do more than just move the camera around the playing area, you can zoom it in and out as well. To try this out, move the mouse backwards and forwards whilst holding both mouse buttons down.
####
## Text 3394 ##
If your mouse has a mouse wheel, you can also zoom the camera by turning the wheel. Take a little time to practice using these controls.
####
## Text 3395 ##
On the left hand side of the screen you can see the Command Center. It contains a range of different menus with which you can direct what happens in the game. The tutorial will introduce you to all of its key functions.
####
## Text 3396 ##
Take a look at the left hand side of the screen. Underneath the overview map at the top, you will see four gold buttons for Buildings, Settlers, Production and Statistics. These are the four basic divisions of the Command Center.
####
## Text 3397 ##
Now left-click on the Woodcutter's Hut in the Command Center.
####
## Text 3398 ##
Now it's time for you to construct your first building. We'll take the Woodcutter's Hut, as this provides your settlement with wood. Without this vital raw material, you've got no chance of building up a settlement.
####
## Text 3399 ##
Build a Woodcutter's Hut at the place indicated on the screen.
####
## Text 3400 ##
Now you'll see an array of dots in the playing area, which inform you about the suitability of the ground for building on. The greener the dots, the less work your Diggers will have in leveling the land to prepare it for building on.
####
## Text 3401 ##
Now sit back and watch as the building takes shape.
####
## Text 3402 ##
Please take a careful look at how the building process develops. First your Diggers level the building site, then the Carriers arrive with the materials required. Your Builders can then get on with constructing the building itself.
####
## Text 3403 ##
All done and dusted! Now watch as one of your settlers grabs an axe and moves into the building. You can tell from the red flag on top of the hut that an industrious little Woodcutter has taken up residence.
####
## Text 3404 ##
Now left-click on the Sawmill.
####
## Text 3405 ##
A Woodcutter supplies your settlement with logs. But before you can construct buildings, these logs have to be made into planks. And this is where the Sawmills in your settlement come in.
####
## Text 3406 ##
Now have your settlers build a Sawmill at the place marked in the playing area.
####
## Text 3407 ##
To keep transportation distances down to a minimum, you should aim to build Sawmills as close as possible to Woodcutter's Huts. If you don't bear this factor in mind, you'll find that it takes a lot longer to build up your settlement.
####
## Text 3408 ##
Now build a Stonecutter's Hut at the place marked.
####
## Text 3409 ##
So far so good. A settlement cannot build with wood alone, however - stone is your construction industry's other essential resource. So you'll have to build a Stonecutter's Hut near a rocky area.
####
## Text 3410 ##
Take a breather now and watch as your settllers get on with the jobs at hand.
####
## Text 3411 ##
Your very own settlement has now been transformed into a hive of activity. By the way, you can also obtain stones from Stone Mines. But as for the mining industry, that will be explained in a separate tutorial.
####
## Text 3412 ##
Very good! You have now laid the foundations for a thriving settlement! Using the raw materials available, you can start to get all the other production processes off the ground.
####
## Text 3413 ##
notext
####
## Text 3414 ##
Click on this text or press the space bar.
####
## Text 3415 ##
In the first mission we saw how to obtain the raw materials wood and stone. However, raw materials alone are not sufficient to expand your settlement,   and you'll soon be needing more settlers.
####
## Text 3416 ##
Build a Forester's Hut at the location shown, please.
####
## Text 3417 ##
To make sure that you don't run out of wood, you should always have a Forester in your settlement. The Forester plants new trees and thus ensures a fresh supply of wood.
####
## Text 3418 ##
Very good! Watch as the Forester takes up his new career with gusto, quickly supplying your settlement with additional trees. These will in turn supply the wood needed for a new Residence.
####
## Text 3419 ##
To build a Residence for new settlers, you'll need stone as well as wood. To make sure that there is an adequate supply of stone, we're going to build a Stone Mine now.
####
## Text 3420 ##
Build a Stone Mine at the place marked on the map!
####
## Text 3421 ##
The mountain to the west is a good place for a Stone Mine. Tutorial 4 will provide more information about how you make use of your Geologists, who help you to find your settlement's natural treasures.
####
## Text 3422 ##
Now watch as one of your settlers grabs a pickaxe and takes himself off to start work in the Mine.
####
## Text 3423 ##
Now build a Small Residence at the place indicated.
####
## Text 3424 ##
Now that the continued supply of raw materials has been guaranteed, you should start increasing your settlement's population.
####
## Text 3425 ##
Once the Residence has been constructed, you will automatically acquire 10 additional settlers.
####
## Text 3426 ##
Now move the camera until you can see the Priest.
####
## Text 3427 ##
To the south of your settlement you'll find a Priest and his escort.
####
## Text 3428 ##
Now center your view of the game over the stone circle.
####
## Text 3429 ##
Good! This little group has to be directed towards the stone circle which you'll find to the south-west of your settlement.
####
## Text 3430 ##
Drag the rectangle around the entire group and then let go of the mouse button.
####
## Text 3431 ##
Very good. Now return the camera to its previous position. Then, in the playing area, left-click above the group. Hold down the left mouse button and draw a rectangle.
####
## Text 3432 ##
Send the group off to the stone circle.
####
## Text 3433 ##
You have now selected the Priest and his bodyguards. If you now right-click anywhere in the playing area, all of your selected units will take themselves off to that point.
####
## Text 3434 ##
Keep the camera centered on the group as they make their way towards the destination selected.
####
## Text 3435 ##
Your group should now make its way towards the stone circle. If you happen to have sent the group in the wrong direction, all you need to do is to reselect them and issue your instructions again.
####
## Text 3436 ##
Bravo! The Priest has reached his destination safe and sound. At this sacred place, he can implore the gods to bestow gifts upon your settlement.  Well done on successfully completing the second tutorial mission.
####
## Text 3437 ##
Welcome to the third tutorial mission, in which we'll be looking at food provision. We're going to supply the Mines we already have with food so that those Miners can get to work on providing you with raw materials.
####
## Text 3438 ##
Now build a Hunter's Hut at the location marked.
####
## Text 3439 ##
You have two options when it comes to meat production. One of these is to build a Hunter's Hut. A Hunter will focus his sights on passing animals and thus provide your settlement with meat.
####
## Text 3440 ##
Build a Fisherman's Hut at the location shown in the east of your settlement.
####
## Text 3441 ##
The Fisherman provides your settlement with fresh fish. Fisherman's Huts should always be built near the coast or a river. It's worth looking out for jumping fish when choosing a suitable location.
####
## Text 3442 ##
Now watch as your Mines are provided with food.
####
## Text 3443 ##
As soon as the Huts have been completed, you can watch as two settlers grab a fishing pole and a bow and then move in to the appropriate building.
####
## Text 3444 ##
Another way of providing your settlement with meat is to build an animal Ranch and a Slaughterhouse.
####
## Text 3445 ##
Build the Grain Farm at the location indicated.
####
## Text 3446 ##
Understandably enough, animals also need to be fed and watered. The Grain Farm provides them with feed. When constructing a Grain Farm, bear in mind that you'll also need sufficient space for a field.
####
## Text 3447 ##
Build a Waterworker's Hut at the location marked.
####
## Text 3448 ##
While the farm is under construction, please issue instructions for a Waterworker's Hut to be built.
####
## Text 3449 ##
Have an animal Ranch built.
####
## Text 3450 ##
Now that you have ensured your animals' supply of food, you can have the Ranch constructed. To keep distances to a minimum, you should build the Ranch between the Waterworker's Hut and the Grain Farm.
####
## Text 3451 ##
Now build a Slaughterhouse near the animal Ranch.
####
## Text 3452 ##
As we mentioned already, your meat industry also requires a Slaughterhouse. Do make sure that you keep the distances that your Carriers have to travel in transporting goods as short as possible.
####
## Text 3453 ##
Now watch as animals are delivered to your Slaughterhouse.
####
## Text 3454 ##
You have now successfully built up the production chain for meat.
####
## Text 3455 ##
Build a second Grain Farm at the place shown.
####
## Text 3456 ##
Your settlement can't survive on meat and fish alone, it also needs bread. This is produced in the Bakery (surprise, surprise!) from flour and water. That means that you'll be needing a Grain Mill to turn the grain into flour.
####
## Text 3457 ##
Build a Bakery now, and then you can enjoy the sight of your Mines being supplied with bread.
####
## Text 3458 ##
Very good! Now all your settlement needs is a Bakery and then bread production can get going.
####
## Text 3459 ##
Excellent! You have now completed all the buildings needed to ensure a steady supply of food in your settlement. There's even enough left over for a party...
####
## Text 3460 ##
Build a Grain Mill at the place indicated.
####
## Text 3461 ##
A very warm welcome to the fourth tutorial!
This mission will tell you everything you need to know about mining and metal processing in the SETTLERS world.
####
## Text 3462 ##
There are a number of materials which can only be obtained from Mines, including iron ore and coal. As these resources are beneath the surface, you have got to discover them first.
####
## Text 3463 ##
In order to discover deposits of raw materials, you need Geologists. These guys are experts in detecting the earth's treasures, and they put up signs informing you about the materials they have found.
####
## Text 3464 ##
Now recruit 10 Geologists.
####
## Text 3465 ##
You train Geologists by selecting this Specialist in the Command Center (this has already been done) and then entering the number you require using the arrow keys in the Command Center.
####
## Text 3466 ##
Send your Geologists off to the mountainous area in the west by right-clicking there.
####
## Text 3467 ##
As mines can only be constructed in the mountains, have your Geologists explore the large range of mountains in the west of your settlement. Select the group of Geologists.
####
## Text 3468 ##
This is what the symbols on the signs indicate: silver bars: iron, black triangles: coal, gold bars: gold, white rectangles: stone, yellow triangles: sulfur.
####
## Text 3469 ##
Let's take a look at the Geologists for a while as they go about their business.
####
## Text 3470 ##
The signs also tell you about the quantity of raw material to be found at that location. The greater the number of symbols (1 to 3), the greater the amount available. You can jump forward by one minute by hitting the F12 key.
####
## Text 3471 ##
Build an Iron Mine at the location marked.
####
## Text 3472 ##
Do pay attention to the signs, as it will be well worth it when your settlement is in need of a particular mineral. You should be able to see several signs which indicate that deposits of iron ore have been found.
####
## Text 3473 ##
Build a Coal Mine at the location marked.
####
## Text 3474 ##
You should also be able to see several signs which point to the presence of coal.
####
## Text 3475 ##
Now build a Gold Mine in the location indicated.
####
## Text 3476 ##
Now take a closer look at the signs which indicate gold deposits.
####
## Text 3477 ##
As soon as the Mines have been completed, one settler per mine will then get on with hacking away at the raw material. Your settlement already has the buildings needed to supply your Miners with food.
####
## Text 3478 ##
Build a Stone Mine at the location marked.
####
## Text 3479 ##
If the rocky areas scattered around your settlement are not sufficient to satisfy your economy's stone requirements, you should make sure that you look out for signs which point to stone deposits beneath the surface.
####
## Text 3480 ##
Now watch as your Mines are finished off.
####
## Text 3481 ##
Sulfur is not actually needed for production purposes in the Roman economy, but can be used for trade with other races. Because of this, we will deal with sulfur in a later tutorial.
####
## Text 3482 ##
Now build an Iron Smelting Works near the mountain.
####
## Text 3483 ##
Your Miners should have already started work by now. That's not the end of the story, though. Some of the raw materials mined have to be processed before they can be used. Iron ore, for example, needs to be turned into iron.
####
## Text 3484 ##
Now build a Gold Smelting Works near the mountain.
####
## Text 3485 ##
Gold is also obtained from the mines in a raw form, and has to be smelted before it can be used for other purposes in your settlement.
####
## Text 3486 ##
Watch as the Smelting Works are constructed.
####
## Text 3487 ##
Iron and gold bars are produced from the metal ores in the Smelting Works.
####
## Text 3488 ##
Now build a Toolsmith's Works near the Iron Smelting Works!
####
## Text 3489 ##
The metal bars (ingots) produced in the Smelting Works can be used for a variety of purposes, including the production of tools and weapons in the Smith's Works.
####
## Text 3490 ##
Now build a Weaponsmith's Works near the Iron Smelting Works.
####
## Text 3491 ##
As soon as the Toolsmith's Works has been completed, select it by left-clicking on it.
####
## Text 3492 ##
The Toolsmith's Works produces all the various tools needed in your settlement.
####
## Text 3493 ##
Click on the button highlighted.
####
## Text 3494 ##
You can use the round button to open the sidebar menu. This is where you can enter the quantity of a particular tool which you would like to produce.
####
## Text 3495 ##
Produce at least two saws and two pickaxes.
####
## Text 3496 ##
Select the tool desired and use the arrow keys to enter the number to be produced. To give instructions for permanent production of that tool, simply click on the horizontal figure 8.
####
## Text 3497 ##
Now select the Weaponsmith's Works.
####
## Text 3498 ##
When you look at the Weaponsmith's context menu, you'll see that it is very similar to that of the Toolsmith's, with production also being directed via a sidebar.
####
## Text 3499 ##
At the top of the menu you can turn automatic weapons production on and off. The bars allow you to enter the proportions for the different types of weapons to be produced.
####
## Text 3500 ##
Have your Weaponsmith produce two swords and two bows.
####
## Text 3501 ##
You can also produce an exact number of weapons of a particular type.
####
## Text 3502 ##
Very good! You have now manufactured your first metal goods, which means that we have come to the end of our introduction to the settlers' metal industry.
####
## Text 3503 ##
Welcome to the fifth tutorial!
In this mission we're going to look at how you can expand your settlement's territory.
####
## Text 3504 ##
You have two options for expanding your territory: you can either construct Towers and Castles, or you can deploy Pioneers.
####
## Text 3505 ##
If you take a look at your Stonecutter's Hut, you'll notice that a large proportion of the rocks which your Stonecutter would just love to hack away actually lie beyond your settlement's boundaries.
####
## Text 3506 ##
Now build a Small Tower at the place indicated.
####
## Text 3507 ##
To enable your Stonecutter to get to work on these rocks, you'll have to push back your frontiers. To do this, build a Tower and occupy it with one of your soldiers.
####
## Text 3508 ##
Now watch your settlement growing before your eyes as soon as the soldier occupies the Tower.
####
## Text 3509 ##
Very good! As soon as a soldier has occupied a Tower or a Castle, your settlement will expand around it.
####
## Text 3510 ##
You've made your Stonecutter a happy man - he can now take his pickaxe to those rocks and continue to supply your settlement's construction industry with stone.
####
## Text 3511 ##
Now select the Large Tower.
####
## Text 3512 ##
If Towers and Castles have to be crushed (to free up additional building materials, for example), the good news is that you won't lose the land you gained when the Tower was built.
####
## Text 3513 ##
Go ahead and pull down the Large Tower, please.
####
## Text 3514 ##
When you select a building by left-clicking on it, that building's context menu will be displayed. The button which looks suspiciously like a bomb allows you to demolish buildings which are surplus to requirements.
####
## Text 3515 ##
Pioneers can also help you to obtain additional land.
####
## Text 3516 ##
Now recruit at least 15 Pioneers.
####
## Text 3517 ##
Do bear in mind that you'll require a shovel for every Pioneer you wish to recruit. As you would expect, we've made sure that for this tutorial at least, there are enough shovels available for this purpose.
####
## Text 3518 ##
Now select all your Pioneers.
####
## Text 3519 ##
You should now get all your Pioneers working on expanding your settlement to the north.
####
## Text 3520 ##
Now send your Pioneers off to the place marked.
####
## Text 3521 ##
Sending the selected units off to where you would like them to work is simply a matter of right-clicking on that location. Once they have arrived, your Pioneers will get on with digging up your border posts of their own accord.
####
## Text 3522 ##
Now sit back and take a look at your Pioneers in action.
####
## Text 3523 ##
Right, that's the first stage out of the way. Now select the Pioneers again and form them into a group so that they can take control of land at the coast.
####
## Text 3524 ##
Now build a Small Tower at the location indicated and occupy it with a soldier.
####
## Text 3525 ##
Your Pioneers have reached firm ground once again. Now build a Tower to protect the land your shovel-wielders have gained for you. Don't forget to dispatch a soldier to the Tower!
####
## Text 3526 ##
Now build a Lookout Tower at the place suggested.
####
## Text 3527 ##
It's about time you risked a glance over the water. Who knows what dangers are lurking on the other side?  You should build a Lookout Tower to enable you to cast your eyes a little further afield.
####
## Text 3528 ##
Once the Lookout Tower has been completed, one of your free-roaming settlers will take up residence there and set about supplying you with valuable information.
####
## Text 3529 ##
Now go to the Command Center and open the sidebar menu containing the Eyecatchers.
####
## Text 3530 ##
You can now make out another settlement on the other side of the water. Because you don't know whether this settlement is well-disposed towards you or not, you should make sure that your soldiers are prepared for battle.
####
## Text 3531 ##
Now build five different Eyecatchers.
####
## Text 3532 ##
When calculating the value of your settlement to determine your soldiers' military strength, the Eyecatchers really prove their worth by contributing a value double that of their construction costs, making them ideal for motivating your soldiers.
####
## Text 3533 ##
A messenger from the other settlement has just arrived to extend the hand of friendship towards your race.
You have now successfully accomplished the fifth tutorial.
####
## Text 3534 ##
Welcome to the sixth tutorial!
In this mission we're going to look at using Storage Areas, founding a new colony and transporting goods to it.
####
## Text 3535 ##
The goods which are produced in a particular building are stored in front of it until the Carriers take them away. When eight units of a good have piled up in front of a building, production will come to a halt.
####
## Text 3536 ##
Now build a Storage Area at the place shown. When it has been completed, select this building.
####
## Text 3537 ##
To prevent production from stopping, build a Storage Area. Carriers will transport all the goods to the Storage Area which you have chosen to have stored.
####
## Text 3538 ##
Now issue instructions for coal to be stored.
####
## Text 3539 ##
Now select the Storage Area by left-clicking on it. The Storage Area's context menu will now appear in the Command Center. This is where you can enter which goods should be stored.
####
## Text 3540 ##
Now it's time for some real expansion. We're going to take a look at how to found a colony.
####
## Text 3541 ##
We've already seen how Carriers take care of transport within your settlement's boundaries. Donkeys enable you to transport goods beyond your frontiers.
####
## Text 3542 ##
xxxxxx
####
## Text 3543 ##
Your settlement already has a Donkey Ranch. The water and grain needed for breeding donkeys are also available.
####
## Text 3544 ##
Now build a Vehicle Hall at the place indicated.
####
## Text 3545 ##
You'll need a cart to found a colony. Carts are built in the Vehicle Hall. Of course, you'd never forget that a Vehicle Maker can't carry out his work without a hammer, would you?
####
## Text 3546 ##
Instruct your Vehicle Maker to build a cart as soon as the Vehicle Hall has been completed.
####
## Text 3547 ##
Now select the Vehicle Hall. You can issue instructions for the vehicles to be built in the sidebar menu.
####
## Text 3548 ##
Load up the cart as soon as it has been completed.
####
## Text 3549 ##
It's time for you to load up the cart with everything needed to found a new colony (construction materials, tools and Pioneers). First select the cart, then simply click on the button shown to get the loading process moving.
####
## Text 3550 ##
Now send the cart off to the location shown to the north.
####
## Text 3551 ##
Now that you've got all the materials needed together, you can send the cart off to the place where you'd like to found a new colony.
####
## Text 3552 ##
Now enjoy watching your Pioneers make the new country your own.
####
## Text 3553 ##
This is a good place for a colony, don't you think? Unload the cart and start building up your new settlement. To do this, simply click on the button which is marked. You can move the game on by one minute by hitting the F12 key.
####
## Text 3554 ##
Now please turn your Pioneers back into Carriers.
####
## Text 3555 ##
Now that you have occupied a bit of land, you can get on with building up your colony. Select all your Pioneers and send them off to the center of the new colony.
####
## Text 3556 ##
Please build a Marketplace at the place indicated.
####
## Text 3557 ##
You'll need a range of goods to get things off the ground in the new settlement. To get these goods from your original settlement to your colony, you'll need to set up a Marketplace.
####
## Text 3558 ##
Set the Marketplace as the starting point.
####
## Text 3559 ##
To deliver goods, you'll need to determine a transport route. Select the Marketplace in your original settlement and set it as the starting point for the journey.
####
## Text 3560 ##
Now set the new Marketplace as the destination.
####
## Text 3561 ##
Now you should set the Marketplace in your colony as the destination for the transport route. Well, you do want the goods to arrive in the right place, don't you?
####
## Text 3562 ##
Deliver stones to the other Marketplace.
####
## Text 3563 ##
The Marketplaces have now been connected. The next step is to enter the goods which you'd like to have transported between the two locations.
####
## Text 3564 ##
Now build a Small Tower in your settlement.
####
## Text 3565 ##
The goods will now be transported to your new eco sector. Don't let your newly-conquered land remain unprotected! Build a Tower to watch over your new colony.
####
## Text 3566 ##
Please send a soldier off to occupy the Tower.
####
## Text 3567 ##
As we've learned already, a Tower is not much use without a soldier to guard it.
####
## Text 3568 ##
Very good!  You have founded your first colony and thus successfully completed the sixth tutorial mission.
####
## Text 3569 ##
Go ahead and recruit two Diggers and Builders.
####
## Text 3570 ##
In your new colony, you'll be needing Diggers and Builders. In order to recruit these workers, the camera has to be over your new eco sector.
####
## Text 3571 ##
Welcome to tutorial number 7!
This mission will introduce you to the magical world of Priests and the spells they cast.
####
## Text 3572 ##
Build a Small Temple at the place indicated.
####
## Text 3573 ##
Before you can go about casting spells, you'll need manna. You obtain this precious substance by sacrificing alcoholic drinks to the gods in Small Temples.
####
## Text 3574 ##
Go ahead and build a Vineyard at the place indicated.
####
## Text 3575 ##
The Romans practice the age-old tradition of offering up wine to the gods. That means that you have to organize the production of this valuable commodity. The gods' thirst is legendary, so you should set up more than one Vineyard.
####
## Text 3576 ##
Set the working area for the Vineyard at the place indicated.
####
## Text 3577 ##
You have to set the working area for every Vineyard you set up. You'll find that vines planted on the sunny side of a slope produce the best results.
####
## Text 3578 ##
Build a Large Temple at the place marked.
####
## Text 3579 ##
Right, that's  your manna production industry off the ground. What you need now are Priests to put the manna to use. Priests are trained in a Large Temple.
####
## Text 3580 ##
Now select the Priest.
####
## Text 3581 ##
As soon as the Temple has been built, you will obtain a Priest. Priests alone have the ability to make use of manna for casting spells.
####
## Text 3582 ##
Now open the sidebar menu.
####
## Text 3583 ##
In the command center, you can see the Priest's context menu. Pressing the round button on the right hand side in this menu allows you to open a sidebar which contains all the spells.
####
## Text 3584 ##
Cast the "Godly Gift" spell, please.
####
## Text 3585 ##
Now left-click on the icon for the "Godly Gift" spell. Then please cast the spell by right-clicking on a place in the playing area near the Priest.
####
## Text 3586 ##
You have now cast your first spell successfully. Although the other spells have a wide variety of effects, they are all cast in the same way.
####
## Text 3587 ##
Congratulations on completing tutorial 7 successfully. Just one little tip at this point - every spell costs you manna. The more often you cast a spell, the more manna it will cost you!

Welcome to the eighth tutorial!
This mission is all about engaging in armed conflict using your military units.
####
## Text 3592 ##
Build a Large Tower at the location shown.
####
## Text 3593 ##
To expand and protect your land, you should build Towers and occupy them with military units. The buildings which allow you to expand your domain are the Castle and the Towers in the two sizes available.
####
## Text 3594 ##
Now select the Large Tower!
####
## Text 3595 ##
To "arm" a Tower, you have to occupy it with at least one Swordsman. Obviously, if more Soldiers are stationed in the Tower, it becomes more difficult to capture.
####
## Text 3596 ##
You can now see the Tower's Context menu in the Command Center. You'll see two buttons (small castles with arrows) in this menu, which allow you to occupy the building with either the mininmum or maximum contingent of soldiers.
####
## Text 3597 ##
Occupy this Tower with the maximum complement of soldiers.
####
## Text 3598 ##
You can also instruct individual soldiers to occupy a military building by selecting the soldier and then right-clicking on the Tower.
####
## Text 3599 ##
Now build a Barracks at the place marked.
####
## Text 3600 ##
To be able to keep occupying Castles and Towers, you'll have to recruit more soldiers. Soldiers are recruited in a Barracks.
####
## Text 3601 ##
Once the Barracks has been completed, it will be supplied with weapons, armor and gold bars. Please bear in mind that you can only recruit soldiers once your Weaponsmith's Works has supplied it with an adequate quantity of weapons.
####
## Text 3602 ##
Now open the Barracks' sidebar menu
####
## Text 3603 ##
When you select the Barracks, its context menu will be displayed in the Command Center. This context menu contains a round button at the bottom right with which you can open a sidebar menu.
####
## Text 3604 ##
To obtain units, you should first mark the unit and then enter the number required using the arrow keys.
####
## Text 3605 ##
Now recruit three Level 2 Bowmen.
####
## Text 3606 ##
Military units are available in a number of strengths - the stronger the unit, the more resources it will cost you. The Bowman level 2 has already been marked.
####
## Text 3607 ##
Now watch as three Bowmen occupy the Large Tower.
####
## Text 3608 ##
When you station Bowmen in a Tower, they'll strengthen your settlement's defenses by firing off volleys of arrows at oncoming enemy invasions.
####
## Text 3609 ##
Now draft four level 2 Swordsmen into your army.
####
## Text 3610 ##
Very good! Capturing this Tower should now be a tall order for enemy troops. Just to be on the safe side, though, you should make sure that you train up a few Swordsmen to provide your Bowmen with some moral support.
####
## Text 3611 ##
Go ahead and send off your Swordsmen to your settlement's southern border.
####
## Text 3612 ##
The enemy has started to take a closer interest in the southern part of your territory...it's a good idea for your Swordsmen to keep an eye on your borders.
####
## Text 3613 ##
Soldiers aren't the only units who can be used for military purposes, though. Thieves, for example, aren't just useful because of their habit of relieving your opponents of their resources - they can also carry out reconnaissance work.
####
## Text 3614 ##
Now recruit a Thief.
####
## Text 3615 ##
To recruit specialists, you first have to select the type of unit desired, and then use the arrow keys to enter the number of specialists you would like to have.
####
## Text 3616 ##
dummy
####
## Text 3617 ##
Enemy soldiers pose a threat not only to your own military units, but also to your specialists. So do make sure that your Thief stays well clear of this threat.
####
## Text 3618 ##
Now recruit ten level 3 Swordsmen.
####
## Text 3619 ##
Aha! Your Thief has just located an enemy Castle! You'd better draft ten more soldiers and then capture the Castle.

####
## Text 3624 ##
Send off your soldiers to attack the Castle.
####
## Text 3625 ##
Before you attack the Castle, it would probably be a good idea to get your soldiers together into a group.
####
## Text 3626 ##
Now build a Healer's Quarters at the location marked.
####
## Text 3627 ##
Some of your soldiers have probably got a few cuts and bruises after all that fighting. Have a Healer's Quarters built so that you can patch them up.
####
## Text 3628 ##
Watch as the Healer tends to your wounded.
####
## Text 3629 ##
Send off your soldiers to the Healer's Quarters to be patched up.
####
## Text 3630 ##
Congratulations!
You have now mastered the eighth tutorial.
####
## Text 3631 ##
Continue
####
## Text 3632 ##
Because you have incurred heavy losses, we're going to provide you with a few new recruits to strengthen your forces. Click on this text now, please.
####
## Text 3633 ##
Now find your Thief and send him off to the south.
####
## Text 3634 ##
To begin with, you'll need to locate your Thief. To do this, you can open the 'Find Settler' menu (under the 'Settlers' menu) and then select the Thief. If you then press one of the buttons at the bottom, your Thief will be marked.
####
## Text 3635 ##
A very warm welcome to tutorial number 9!
This mission introduces you to the special characteristics of the Mayans.
####
## Text 3636 ##
Now recruit 10 Blowgun Warriors of level 1
####
## Text 3637 ##
The Mayans' special unit is the Blowgun Warrior. Ok, we have to admit that this particular warrior doesn't do that much damage with his attacks. But his poisoned arrows are just the ticket for paralyzing opponents.
####
## Text 3638 ##
Please build a firespitter in the Vehicle Hall.
####
## Text 3639 ##
The Mayans' war machine is the firespitter. This nasty piece of work hurls fire balls at enemy buildings - a habit which is very unlikely to go down well with the Vikings and Romans.
####
## Text 3640 ##
Firespitters are armed with gunpowder, which is manufactured in the Gunpowder Maker's Works from sulfur and coal.
####
## Text 3641 ##
Now build a Sulfur Mine at the place shown.
####
## Text 3642 ##
Sulfur is obtained from a Sulfur Mine.
####
## Text 3643 ##
Now build a Gunpowder Maker's Works at the place suggested.
####
## Text 3644 ##
You'll need a Gunpowder Maker's Works to produce the ammunition itself from sulfur and coal.
####
## Text 3645 ##
Sit back and watch as gunpowder is manufactured.
####
## Text 3646 ##
The highly explosive gunpowder is manufactured in the Gunpowder Maker's Works. You should always make sure that you have a few shots at the ready to keep your firespitter going.
####
## Text 3647 ##
Now ensure that the firespitter is loaded up with ammunition.
####
## Text 3648 ##
Firespitters can be loaded with ammunition in two ways: either automatically, by driving past a goods pile, or manually, by selecting the firespitter and clicking on the 'loading' button.
####
## Text 3649 ##
Go ahead and attack the Tower with your firespitter.
####
## Text 3650 ##
One of your Priests is being held prisoner in the enemy Tower. This sounds like a mission for your firespitter, don't you think? The Blowgun Warriors provide a suitable escort for the war machine.
####
## Text 3651 ##
Now use the "Punish Bowmen" spell upon the enemy Bowmen.
####
## Text 3652 ##
Very good! The newly liberated Priest has the power to work wonders. He has a number of tricks up his sleeve, including the spell "Punish Bowmen", which allows you to turn enemy archers into butterflies.
####
## Text 3653 ##
Well done! You have successfully completed tutorial number 9.
####
## Text 3654 ##
Send your Geologists off to the place marked on the map.
####
## Text 3655 ##
In order to obtain sulfur, a natural resource which is of enormous value to the Mayans, you'll need to start off by dispatching your Geologists to the hills.
####
## Text 3656 ##
First a few words about alcohol production. As you can already see on the map, the Mayans produce tequila. First they plant agaves, which are then processed into the hard stuff in the Tequila Maker's Works.
####
## Text 3657 ##

####
## Text 3658 ##
Welcome to the tenth tutorial! This mission is intended to familiarize you with some of the special characteristics of those hardy Vikings.
####
## Text 3659 ##
Build a Shipyard at the place indicated, please!
####
## Text 3660 ##
The Vikings have a deserved reputation as a seafaring race. But just like the Mayans and the Romans, they can't set sail for foreign shores without a shipbuilding industry. Ships are constructed in a Shipyard.
####
## Text 3661 ##
No Text
####
## Text 3662 ##
No Text
####
## Text 3663 ##
Build a warship in the Shipyard, please.
####
## Text 3664 ##
The Vikings are experts in pillaging and plundering and their warship is the terror of the high seas.
####
## Text 3665 ##
Get in some shooting practice and destroy the Large Tower at the coast.
####
## Text 3666 ##
The Viking warship uses the fearsome weapon Thor's Hammer, which can reduce any military building to rubble with a single shot. Thor's Hammer is so special it can only be armed with the help of the gods and runs on manna.
####
## Text 3667 ##
Now get the Priest to try this spell out.
####
## Text 3668 ##
The Viking's magical weapon can also be used on land. If a sufficient quantity of manna is available, Viking Priests can cast the 'Thor's Hammer' spell in order to destroy enemy buildings.
####
## Text 3669 ##
Go ahead and recruit 15 Thieves, please.
####
## Text 3670 ##
Thieves are extremely valuable specialists. Not only are they useful for reconnaissance purposes, they also enjoy relieving your opponents of precious goods and raw materials.
####
## Text 3671 ##
Send your Thieves off into enemy territory to steal at least 10 iron bars.
####
## Text 3672 ##
You're soon going to be needing a number of battle axes for a special mission. Unfortunately, your Geologists have not found any iron in your settlement. This sounds like a job for your Thieves.
####
## Text 3673 ##
Instruct your Weaponsmith's Works to manufacture at least 10 battle axes.
####
## Text 3674 ##
Excellent! Your Weaponsmith's Works now has the resources needed to get working on those battle axes we mentioned a little earlier.
####
## Text 3675 ##
Go ahead and recruit 10 Axe Warriors.
####
## Text 3676 ##
Battle axes are needed for recruiting the Viking's special military unit, the Axe Warrior. Axe Warriors are prone to neglect their defense, but their offensive strength means that they can destroy military buildings.
####
## Text 3677 ##
Destroy all the enemy's Small Towers.
####
## Text 3678 ##
There are a number of Roman buildings which your Axe Warriors would just love to get their teeth (not to mention their axes) into.
####
## Text 3679 ##
You did it!
####
## Text 3680 ##
Congratulations on successfully completing the tenth tutorial!
####
## Text 3681 ##
Stop production at the Weaponsmith's Works, please.
####
## Text 3682 ##
At the moment your supplies of iron are waiting to be processed at the Weaponsmith's Works. In order to make these available for the Shipyard, you will have to stop the production of weapons for the moment.
####
## Text 3683 ##
Restart production at the Weaponsmith's Works now, please.
####
## Text 3684 ##
To be able to produce battle axes, you will have to restart production at the Weaponsmith's Works.

Welcome to the twelfth and final tutorial. This mission deals with a particularly unpleasant phenomenon...
####
## Text 3708 ##
In the east of your settlement, you'll find a barren piece of land. This is nothing other than Dark Land, which cannot be used for building or mining.
####
## Text 3709 ##
Now recruit 10 Gardeners.
####
## Text 3710 ##
Your Woodcutter can no longer chop down any trees because he is surrounded by Dark Land. To turn this soil back into the green and fertile variety, you'll have to set your Gardeners to work on it.
####
## Text 3711 ##
Instruct the Gardeners to regenerate the land.
####
## Text 3712 ##
Now select the Gardeners and right-click on the Dark Land. As soon as they have reached their destination, the green-fingered ones will get on with restoring the land to its former glory.
####
## Text 3713 ##
Let's sit back and watch them for a while as they set about their important environmental mission.
####
## Text 3714 ##
As you can see, your Gardeners turn dark land back into green and fertile soil.
####
## Text 3715 ##
It's about time your Woodcutter got back to work, don't you agree?
####
## Text 3716 ##
Your Gardeners' abilities have far-reaching implications for your economy, as trees and Stone Mines are also returned to their former glory.
####
## Text 3717 ##
Keep watching until the Sawmill has once again been supplied with logs.
####
## Text 3718 ##
Dark land is home to some spooky-looking mushrooms. Fortunately, your Gardeners know how to deal with this sort of unwelcome vegetation.
####
## Text 3719 ##
Let your Gardeners work away until your settlement has been completely freed of the blight of mushrooms.
####
## Text 3720 ##
Now you have successfully completed all twelve tutorials! You're now in a position to protect the Settlers world from the hideous Dark Tribe. We're sure you'll rise to the challenge.
####
## Text 3721 ##
Welcome to the eleventh tutorial!
This will give you a chance to put what you've learned into practice.
####
## Text 3722 ##
Woodcutter's Hut, Sawmill, Forester's Hut, Stonecutter's Hut
####
## Text 3723 ##
Set up a construction industry.
####
## Text 3724 ##
Grain Farm, Waterworker's Hut, Sheep Ranch, Grain Mill, Bakery, Slaughterhouse, Fisherman's Hut
####
## Text 3725 ##
Now please build up a food production industry. And don't forget that you'll be needing additional settlers to get all the work done!
####
## Text 3726 ##
Iron, Coal and Gold Mines, Iron and Gold Smelting Works.
####
## Text 3727 ##
Now have a look for raw materials and build the appropriate Mines and Smelting Works to obtain and process the metal ores.
####
## Text 3728 ##
Barracks, Toolsmith's and Weaponsmith's Works, Vineyard, Small Temple
####
## Text 3729 ##
The time has come to construct the buildings needed for recruiting soldiers. You should also ensure that your settlement's production of manna gets into swing.
####
## Text 3730 ##
Eyecatchers, Large Temple, at least 30 Swordsmen and 20 Bowmen of Level 1.
####
## Text 3731 ##
It's about time you started recruiting soldiers. To make sure that they are motivated to fight for your settlement, you should also put up a few Eyecatchers. This would also be a good time to put up a Large Temple.
####
## Text 3732 ##
You can also send your Priests into battle.
####
## Text 3733 ##
Now launch an attack on the enemy and destroy all your opponent's Towers.
####
## Text 3734 ##
Congratulations on completing the eleventh tutorial with flying colors.

## Text 3746 ##
These forests have long been hearth and home for intrepid warriors. In battle we have laughed and sung, marching to the brink and beyond. Our mighty firs are now being felled by a tribe to make room for their buildings of stone. They will soon learn the danger of our laughter and the ferocity of our songs. 
There are no smiles on the faces of our bearded brethren, the priests. They have entered council, arguing the meanings of the strange omens that have visited them. The great bear has come in their dreams, full upright and growling grievously. What this can mean is not yet clear. It is all too clear, however, that we must rid our forests of these stone-builders.
####
## Text 3747 ##
We have dealt the horde of stone builders, these Mayans, a severe blow and have set them scampering back to wherever they came from - the ones that could still scamper, that is. In battle they are clever warriors and inflicted more injury than we had reckoned on. Wounds must heal quickly though and blades must be resharpened, since we have word that the Romans have been sighted nearby.  It will not be long before they become aware of us.
The dreams of the great bear continue to visit our priests. In them, the bear wanders through the woods as if seeking shelter from the sieges of a terrible storm. Never before have our priests experienced so much distress and never before have they had so little to reveal from their wondrous arts. We cannot afford to be distracted now - the Roman wolf is on the prowl.
####
## Text 3748 ##
The Romans delivered no less a battle than we expected. Great cries were unleashed on both sides for the horrible losses.  Our high-beamed halls will soon be filled with song and mead we fear. Cleverness and discipline have been combined and our horned helms will be pointed at an unholy alliance of the Romans and the Mayans. Our blows will need the power of thunder if we are to succeed.
The great bear now only limps on through blackened snow in the dreams of our priests. Its proud stance has been bowed, its will seemingly broken. In none of the tales of yore has such sadness found the bard's breath. But now is a time of council for our warriors - together our enemies will be very formidable.
####
## Text 3749 ##
Regular waves of Mayan reinforcements are landing near our base settlement. If we do not build up our defenses, our opponents will soon have the upper hand. It is also well worth exploring to the east, as a little research may bring its rewards.
